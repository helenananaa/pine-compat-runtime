# Diagnostic Codes

Diagnostic codes are part of the public developer experience. Messages can be
improved over time, but codes should remain stable once published.

## Lexing

- `E_LEX_CHAR`: unexpected character.
- `E_LEX_COLOR`: invalid color literal.
- `E_LEX_FLOAT`: invalid float literal.
- `E_LEX_INDENT`: indentation is not a supported multiple of spaces.
- `E_LEX_INT`: invalid integer literal.
- `E_LEX_STRING`: unterminated or invalid string literal.
- `E_LEX_STRING_LIMIT`: decoded string literal exceeds 40,960 characters.
- `E_LEX_VERSION`: invalid version directive.

## Parsing

- `E_PARSE_BLOCK`: invalid or unterminated statement block.
- `E_PARSE_ASSIGN`: invalid reassignment.
- `E_PARSE_DECL`: invalid declaration.
- `E_PARSE_EXPECTED`: expected token was missing.
- `E_PARSE_EXPR`: expected expression.
- `E_PARSE_EXPR_DEPTH`: expression nesting exceeds the parser limit.
- `E_PARSE_EXPORT`: invalid export declaration.
- `E_PARSE_FOR`: invalid for-loop declaration.
- `E_PARSE_FUNCTION`: invalid function declaration.
- `E_PARSE_METHOD`: invalid user-defined method declaration.
- `E_PARSE_IF_EXPR`: invalid if expression.
- `E_PARSE_IMPORT`: invalid import declaration.
- `E_PARSE_LIBRARY`: invalid library declaration.
- `E_PARSE_NAME`: invalid qualified name.
- `E_PARSE_SWITCH`: invalid switch expression.
- `E_PARSE_TYPE`: invalid user-defined type declaration.
- `E_LANGUAGE_VERSION_DUPLICATE`: more than one recognized `//@version=N`
  directive, including the spaced-equals compatibility form, was found.
- `E_LANGUAGE_VERSION_PLACEMENT`: a recognized version directive appeared
  after a source statement instead of in the leading comment/directive region.

## Semantic Analysis

- `E_HOST_INPUT`: a host binding rejected malformed input before semantic
  analysis, such as invalid WASM library-source JSON.
- `E_LANGUAGE_VERSION_`: internal diagnostic-family prefix used to stop before
  ordinary semantic analysis; this prefix is not emitted as a complete code.
- `E_LANGUAGE_VERSION_CONFLICT`: root and host-provided library sources select
  different Pine language versions.
- `E_LANGUAGE_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`: the selected Pine language version is
  outside the supported closed range v1 through v6.
- `E_LEGACY_INDICATOR_DECLARATION`: a legacy source has a missing, mixed, modern,
  or otherwise inadmissible indicator declaration; the verified v1-v4
  `study()` subsets are executable.
- `E_LEGACY_INPUT_OVERLOAD`: a Pine v1-v4 `input()` call has an ambiguous,
  uninferable, forged, or unsupported historical type selection; the call is
  rejected before canonical lowering or runtime.
- `E_LEGACY_INPUT_CONSTANT_CONTEXT`: a legacy input type constant such as
  `input.integer` is used outside the `type` selector of a versioned `input()`
  annotation; internal selector markers cannot be consumed as ordinary
  strings or propagated through aliases and expressions.
- `E_LEGACY_OUTPUT_ARGUMENT`: a Pine v1-v4 output call uses an invalid historical
  transparency/style value or mixes incompatible fill endpoints; the call is
  rejected before canonical lowering or runtime.
- `E_LEGACY_REFERENCE_GRAPH`: a Pine v1/v2 declaration graph has a duplicate or
  otherwise structurally invalid global declaration.
- `E_LEGACY_REFERENCE_GRAPH_LIMIT`: an active Pine v1/v2 declaration graph
  exceeds 256 nodes or 4096 dependency edges.
- `E_LEGACY_REFERENCE_GRAPH_UNSAFE`: a Pine v1/v2 declaration that actually
  requires self/forward graph resolution has an initializer containing a call,
  mutation, output, request, tuple, or complex control flow outside the
  side-effect-free scalar subset. Earlier source-order prerequisites that are
  neither predeclared nor reordered are checked by their ordinary analyzer
  path instead.
- `E_LEGACY_FORWARD_REFERENCE_UNSAFE`: a Pine v1/v2 current-bar forward
  dependency crosses a non-declaration statement or unsafe-initializer barrier
  and cannot be safely reordered.
- `E_LEGACY_REFERENCE_CYCLE`: Pine v1/v2 current-bar declaration dependencies
  contain a cycle with no deterministic source-compatible evaluation order.
- `E_LEGACY_REFERENCE_TYPE`: the bounded Pine v1/v2 declaration graph cannot
  infer one stable scalar type for a participating declaration.
- `E_LEGACY_RSI_OVERLOAD`: a v1-v4 `rsi(x, y)` call cannot select the
  historical length or two-series overload from the analyzed numeric types;
  the call is rejected instead of guessing modern `ta.rsi` behavior.
- `E_LEGACY_SECURITY_MERGE`: a v1-v4 `security` gaps/lookahead argument is not
  a compile-time bool or the corresponding `barmerge` constant; runtime
  alignment is not guessed from series metadata.
- `E_LEGACY_STRATEGY_OUT_OF_SCOPE`: a v1-v4 source declares `strategy()` or
  references `strategy.*`; legacy strategy execution is outside this project.
- `E_LEGACY_V3_NA_INFERENCE`: a Pine v3 untyped `na` declaration cannot infer
  exactly one stable scalar type from a later assignment because it is
  unresolved, collection/object-valued, or conflicts with another assignment;
  the declaration is rejected without relaxing v4-v6 typing.
- `E_LEGACY_VERSION_FEATURE`: a legacy source directly uses a qualified
  built-in spelling that was introduced by a later Pine dialect; canonical
  names produced internally by verified legacy translations remain allowed.

The legacy release audit compares every `E_LEGACY_*` and `W_LEGACY_*` token
emitted by semantic/runtime source with this document. All 16 current legacy
codes are listed here; Phase 11 adds no public diagnostic family and does not
change the current analysis `schemaVersion: 5` or runtime `schemaVersion: 8`.

  conditional leaf, does not end with a value-producing expression.

  limited to scalar literals, signed numeric literals, supported built-in input
  variables and named constants, without calls, user variables or calculations.
- `E_FUNCTION_DEFAULT_TYPE`: function default is incompatible with its declared
  scalar type, uses untyped na, uses v6 bool na, defaults a reference parameter, or resolves
  an omitted default to a reference value in the caller.

  user-defined function call.
- `E_FUNCTION_ARG_TYPE`: user-defined function argument type does not match the

- `E_IMPORT_DUPLICATE_EXPORT`: a library exports the same name more than once.
- `E_IMPORT_FUNCTION_SIDE_EFFECT`: an exported library function uses side
  effects that are not supported in imported functions.

## Runtime

- `E_RUNTIME`: runtime execution emitted a host-visible diagnostic.
- `W_LEGACY_SECURITY_LOOKAHEAD`: a reached legacy `security` callsite uses
  historical lookahead-on alignment, whether by v1/v2 default or explicit
  selection, and can repaint. The warning
  is emitted once per distinct callsite in stable order and does not fail
  execution.
- `E_STRATEGY_MODE`: strategy-only feature is used outside `strategy()` mode or
  an unsupported strategy mode was requested.

  available simulated equity.

  lower-timeframe bars.

  OHLC bar.
- `E_MAGNIFIER_CHART_BAR_RANGE`: a magnifier group index is outside the
  supplied chart-bar range.
- `E_MAGNIFIER_CHART_BAR_COUNT_REQUIRED`: one-bar incremental or
  realtime-history execution received non-empty magnifier input without a
  complete chart-bar-count preflight before bar zero.

- `E_MAGNIFIER_FORMING_BAR`: magnifier input targets a live/forming or
  live-confirmed realtime bar.
- `W_MAGNIFIER_FALLBACK`: magnifier data is absent for a chart bar, so the
  runtime uses that bar's standard OHLC path.
- `W_MAGNIFIER_GAP`: magnifier data has a gap at a chart bar, so the runtime
- `E_SESSION_SCHEMA_VERSION`: session window host input schemaVersion is not 1.
- `E_SESSION_MALFORMED`: session window host JSON cannot be decoded.
- `E_SESSION_DUPLICATE_BAR`: session window input repeats a barIndex.

- `E_SESSION_COVERAGE`: session window input is missing a required chart barIndex.
- `E_SESSION_HISTORY_CHANGED`: session window replacement/extension changes an executed confirmed or forming bar's ids, or enables host-window mode after UTC execution.
  uses that bar's standard OHLC path.


## Streaming replica

These errors reject an incoming delta without mutating the consumer result or
revision. They do not change the existing runtime output schema.

- `E_STREAM_SCHEMA`: changes schema is unsupported; use schema 2.
- `E_STREAM_REVISION`: revision does not immediately follow baseRevision.
- `E_STREAM_STALE`: change revision precedes the consumer's current revision.
- `E_STREAM_CONFLICT`: the current revision has a different payload, or was
  installed from a snapshot without a known last payload. Only an identical
  retransmission of the last applied delta is a no-op.
- `E_STREAM_GAP`: baseRevision does not match the consumer cursor; restore an
  authoritative snapshot with its revision before continuing.

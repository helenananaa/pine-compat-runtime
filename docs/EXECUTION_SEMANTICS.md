# Execution Semantics

Pine Compat Runtime should be designed around time-series execution, not around
ordinary one-shot script execution.

The central rule is:

```text
The program is evaluated once for each bar, in order.
Each execution can read previously committed series values.
Each execution commits new series values for later bars.
```

## Historical Batch Execution

The first runtime mode should execute a fixed historical data set:

```text
for bar_index in 0..bars.len():
  set current OHLCV built-ins
  execute global scope
  execute reached local scopes
  collect output side effects
  commit series values
```

This mode is easier to test and should be completed before realtime execution.

## Realtime Execution

Realtime execution introduces forming bars, repeated updates on the same bar,
rollback, and later `varip` behavior. This should be a separate milestone.

The first public releases should either reject realtime-only features or mark
them as approximate.

## Execution Clock

`timenow` is the host-provided UNIX millisecond timestamp of the current
script execution, not the current bar's opening or closing time. Historical
batch execution accepts exactly one timestamp per bar. Incremental historical
execution uses `append_bar_with_execution_time`, and realtime execution uses
`update_with_execution_time`; the corresponding batch helpers accept an
execution-time slice alongside bars and the other host inputs.

The clock is explicit so a fixed program, bars, inputs, request streams, and
execution timestamps always produce the same result. A supplied batch whose
timestamp count differs from its bar count fails before any bar runs. If a
reached expression reads `timenow` without an execution timestamp, that
execution fails; scripts and branches that do not read it retain the ordinary
clock-free APIs. The runtime never reads the process wall clock and never
substitutes `time`, `time_close`, or `last_bar_time`.

Each successful execution commits the current `timenow` value into ordinary
series history. Repeated realtime forming updates roll back the current bar and
recompute it with the newly supplied timestamp, just like other current-bar
state. A replacement forming update can therefore observe a different
`timenow` while `timenow[1]` continues to refer to the last committed bar.

## Legacy Indicator Expression Semantics

Pine v1-v4 indicators use version-selected semantics where a current-language
rewrite would change results. These rules are carried in HIR or selected from
the HIR language version, so CLI, Python, WASM, historical, incremental, and
realtime execution use the same contract. They never activate in v5/v6 source
resolution, and they do not enable a legacy strategy path.

`iff(condition, result1, result2)` binds the historical parameter names and
evaluates `condition`, `result1`, and `result2` exactly once in that order.
Both result expressions therefore advance their independent stateful callsites
on every reached call. A true condition selects `result1`; false or `na`
selects `result2`. The current compatibility slice accepts scalar numeric,
bool, string, color, and `na` results and merges their types and qualifiers
with the same branch rules used elsewhere. Ordinary `?:` remains lazy.

`offset(source, offset)` binds the historical `source`/`offset` signature and
lowers structurally to the native history HIR node rather than a runtime helper.
It therefore shares constant-retention analysis, guarded dynamic integer
offsets, `max_bars_back`, `na`, negative-offset diagnostics, expression-series
storage, and realtime rollback with `source[offset]`.

Pine v4 `rsi(x, y)` selects its overload from the second argument's analyzed
type. A non-series integer uses canonical `ta.rsi(source, length)`. A series
integer or any numeric float uses the historical two-series formula
`100 - 100 / (1 + x / y)` and the runtime's ordinary finite arithmetic and
`na` propagation. Non-numeric or otherwise ambiguous forms fail analysis with
`E_LEGACY_RSI_OVERLOAD`; they do not guess a length overload.

For `time()` and `time_close()`, a session string without an explicit day
suffix uses Monday through Friday when the HIR language version is v1-v4 and
all seven days for v5/v6. An explicit `:days` suffix always wins, and `24x7`
always means all days. `input.session` strings are retained verbatim; the
effective default-day policy is passed separately to session parsing.

`and` and `or` evaluate both operands in v1-v5 and short-circuit only in v6.
This includes stateful calls in the right operand. The v4 aliases `change`,
`highest`, `lowest`, `max`, and `min` lower respectively to `ta.change`,
`ta.highest`, `ta.lowest`, `math.max`, and `math.min` only after user-defined
and lexical resolution fails.

Pine v1/v2 global scalar declarations may use self-history and safe forward
references. Analysis activates a bounded dependency graph only for declarations
that need it, predeclares one canonical symbol per active node, and uses a
stable topological order for current-bar dependencies. History-only cycles are
accepted only when one stable scalar type can be inferred. Current cycles,
side-effecting initializers, statement-crossing current dependencies, and
graphs above 256 nodes or 4096 edges fail before HIR. The runtime sees ordinary
canonical declarations and history nodes, not a separate graph evaluator.

In v1/v2 arithmetic, bool operands are explicitly lowered through `float` so
true becomes 1 and false becomes 0. In v1-v5 conditions, `not`, `and`, and `or`,
numeric and `na` operands are explicitly lowered through `bool`: zero and `na`
are false and every other numeric value is true. Pine v3-v6 reject implicit bool
arithmetic, and v6 rejects implicit numeric conditions. These inserted calls
count against ordinary lowering and callsite limits.

### Legacy release execution gates

Every source in `tests/fixtures/legacy/release_profiles.tsv` must match a full
historical batch run when appended incrementally and when handed to the
realtime engine as historical bars. Ordinary v1-v4 rows must also survive a
mutated forming update, replacement forming update, rollback, and final
confirmation with a result equal to batch execution. All requested-data rows
run through their declared chart/provider profile, and rows with an
execution-clock profile supply the declared per-execution timestamps in every
execution mode. Runtime profile storage is counted against the manifest
ceiling.

The sole deliberate equality exception is the experimental v2 historical
`security` lookahead profile. Historical `lookahead_on` may repaint prior/final
historical values, while forming or confirmed realtime updates may only use
confirmed requested values. Its release gate therefore asserts that the
realtime value stays `na` where batch history has a future-backfilled value;
making those results equal would leak future data. This profile is not claimed
as batch/realtime value parity.

## Strategy Mode

`strategy(...)` selects strategy mode for historical execution.
Strategy-mode runtime results include a `strategy` object with `orders`,
`trades`, `position`, `equity`, and `diagnostics` arrays. Indicator-mode
runtime results do not include this key.
`strategy(..., initial_capital=N)` accepts a positive const numeric starting
cash value; when omitted, the runtime uses 100000.
With the currently supported default account-currency path (`currency.NONE`),
`strategy.account_currency` inherits the fixed `syminfo.currency` value,
currently `"USD"`. Explicit `strategy(..., currency=currency.NONE)` selects
the same no-conversion path. In that path,
`strategy.convert_to_account(value)` and `strategy.convert_to_symbol(value)`
return the numeric input as a series float, coercing integers and preserving
typed `na`. Direct, named, UDF, and history calls are supported; indicator and
requested-context calls are rejected. Other strategy currency values and
cross-currency conversion remain unsupported, and neither helper expands
public strategy JSON.
`strategy(..., default_qty_type=strategy.fixed, default_qty_value=N)` accepts a
positive const numeric fixed default entry quantity.
`strategy(..., default_qty_type=strategy.cash, default_qty_value=N)` accepts a
positive const numeric cash amount. When a supported `strategy.entry` omits
`qty`, the cash subset calculates the absolute quantity once at placement time as
`N / close`, using the current close and the current no-currency-conversion
boundary.
`strategy(..., default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value=N)`
accepts a positive const numeric default entry percentage. When a supported
`strategy.entry` omits `qty`, the percent-of-equity subset calculates the
absolute quantity once at placement time as
`strategy.equity * N / 100 / close`, using the current supported equity and
current close. `strategy.default_entry_qty(fill_price)` returns the same
configured default size without placing an order: fixed sizing returns `N`,
cash sizing returns `N / fill_price`, and percent-of-equity sizing returns
`strategy.equity * N / 100 / fill_price`. It does not add the quantity needed
to reverse an existing position. Direct, named, UDF, and history reads are
supported; non-positive or non-finite prices return `na` in the price-dependent
modes, as does non-positive or non-finite equity in percent mode. Indicator and
requested-context use are rejected, and the helper does not expand public
strategy JSON. Contracts, margin constraints beyond the current explicit-margin
long and short subsets, cross-currency conversion, symbol precision rounding, and
lot-step constraints remain unsupported.
`strategy(..., commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_contract,
commission_value=N)` accepts a finite non-negative const numeric
cash-per-contract commission. `strategy(...,
commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_order, commission_value=N)`
accepts a finite non-negative const numeric cash-per-order commission.
`strategy(..., commission_type=strategy.commission.percent,
commission_value=N)` accepts a finite non-negative const numeric percentage
commission and debits `qty * fill_price * N / 100` on each supported entry and
exit fill.
`strategy(..., slippage=N)` accepts finite non-negative integer const ticks
using the fixed `syminfo.mintick` subset.
`strategy(..., backtest_fill_limits_assumption=N)` accepts finite non-negative
integer const ticks and requires supported limit-order fills to move that many
fixed `syminfo.mintick` ticks past the limit price while preserving the limit
fill price. Other commission modes and richer fill models remain unsupported.
`strategy(..., margin_long=N, margin_short=N)` accepts finite non-negative
const numeric declaration values and stores their explicit presence in the
internal strategy settings. Stage 7 Margin Slice M2 uses explicit active
`margin_long` for long-only `strategy.opentrades.capital_held`; Stage 7 Margin
Slice M3 also checks supported long entry affordability at the actual fill
price. Stage 7 Margin Slice M5 implements the first long-only forced
liquidation subset using `bar.low`, the documented available-funds algorithm,
and whole-unit truncation. `strategy.margin_liquidation_price` returns the
price where supported equity equals required margin for an active `margin_long`
long position or an active `margin_short` short position, or `na` without an
active margin setting for the current exposure, while flat, or when the
long-margin denominator is unattainable. Symbol tick rounding for the
liquidation price and margin-specific public schema expansion remain
unsupported.
`strategy(..., close_entries_rule="FIFO")` is accepted as an explicit default
FIFO close-entry allocation setting. `strategy(..., close_entries_rule="ANY")`
is stored in internal strategy settings and is fixture-backed for the current
id-specific long and short `strategy.close(id)` and
`strategy.exit(..., from_entry=id)` allocation subset, including same-entry-id
partial exits in stable ledger order. Omitted-`from_entry` exits and
`strategy.close_all()` keep the existing FIFO allocation path.

The current entry subset is `strategy.entry(id, strategy.long, qty=...)`,
`strategy.entry(id, strategy.long)` when a fixed default quantity is configured,
`strategy.entry(..., limit=price)` for long limit entries,
`strategy.entry(id, strategy.short, qty=..., limit=price)` for short limit
entries while flat or already short,
`strategy.entry(..., stop=price)` for long stop entries, and
`strategy.entry(id, strategy.short, qty=..., stop=price)` for short stop
entries while flat or already short. Supplying both `stop`
and `limit` creates a long or short stop-limit entry matching the direction.
Market entries fill at the next
historical bar open. Limit and stop entries never fill on their creation bar.
On a later historical bar, supported price-based entries, generic orders,
exits, and margin calls walk the bar's inferred path before script statements:
open, high, low, close when the open is closer to the high than to the low;
otherwise open, low, high, close, including equal-distance bars under the
sample-locked ADAUSDT analogue. Events are collected without mutating broker
state and applied one winner at a time. Ranking uses scheduler phase, path
leg, crossing order on that leg, user fills before a same-mark margin call,
then creation sequence and a stable internal key. There is no global
entry-before-exit or long-before-short type rank. Same-price ties use that
creation-sequence/key order only; that is this runtime's determinism contract,
not a TradingView private-order claim.
Long limit entries fill at the limit price when the path visits a price at or
below the limit, or below the configured verified limit threshold. Short limit
entries fill at the limit price when the path visits a price at or above the
limit, or above the configured verified limit threshold. Long stop entries
fill at the stop price when the path visits a price at or above the stop.
Short stop entries fill at the stop price when the path visits a price at or
below the stop.
Long stop-limit entries activate when the path visits a price at or above the
stop. On a high-first bar they may fill at the limit on the same bar after
activation when the path later visits a price at or below the limit, or below
the configured verified limit threshold. Short and low-first stop-limit fills
stay fail-closed until a later bar: short stop-limit entries activate when the
path visits a price at or below the stop and fill at the limit on a later
historical bar when the path visits a price at or above the limit, or above
the configured verified limit threshold. Trailing activation, ratchet, and
fill use only visited path marks.
Pending entries emit no public order while pending. Only one net long position
is supported; repeated entry calls while a position is open are ignored under
the current no-pyramiding rule. Explicit `qty` overrides the declaration
default. The resolved quantity, limit price, and stop price must be positive,
and non-positive runtime values are reported in the strategy diagnostics array.
Configured slippage worsens supported long entry fill prices after trigger
selection.
Supported `strategy.exit` calls use the pending-exit model described below.
Same-calculation absolute `strategy.exit` attachment may target a matching
active pending entry id and remains internal until that entry fills.
`strategy.cancel(id)` searches pending entries, generic orders, exits,
deferred relative exits, and pending closes through one order-book lookup and
cancels every matching public id, including when those families share an id.
Unknown, already-filled, and already-cancelled ids are no-op. Cancellation
records no public order, trade, or pending-order output.
`strategy.cancel_all()` clears all currently supported pending entries, generic
orders, exits, reservations, deferred relative exits, pending closes,
stop-limit activation, and OCA membership exactly once. It is a no-op when no
supported pending order exists and records no public order, trade, or
pending-order output.

`strategy.close(id)` places a market close that fills the matching long
position at the next historical bar open. `strategy.close(id, qty=...)` and
`strategy.close(id, qty_percent=...)` can close part of the matching long
position; quantity policy is stored at placement and resolved at fill, and
fixed `qty` wins when both quantity forms are present. Fixed and
percent quantities must be finite and positive, oversized quantities clamp to
the matching position size at fill, and invalid quantities leave position,
pending exit, and trade state unchanged while emitting a strategy diagnostic.
Configured slippage worsens the supported long close fill price after trigger
selection. A close records a closed trade with entry/exit bar indexes,
entry/exit times, entry/exit prices, quantity, and net realized profit after
supported commission when configured. Partial closes append a remaining
position snapshot at the same average price and keep matching pending exits;
full closes append a flat position snapshot with `size = 0` and
`avgPrice = null` and cancel matching pending exits. If no position is open at
fill time, the id does not match an open entry, or the position has already been
closed, the close is a no-op. Script-visible state on the signal bar remains
pre-fill.

After each historical bar, strategy mode appends an equity snapshot with
`barIndex`, `cash`, `marketValue`, `equity`, and `netProfit`. Open long
positions are marked to the current bar close, `equity = cash + marketValue`,
and the snapshot field `netProfit = equity - initial_capital`, so that public
output field includes current open profit while a long position is open. The
expression variable `strategy.netprofit` is narrower: it is cumulative realized
closed-trade profit only and excludes current open profit. The current subset
supports only `strategy.commission.cash_per_contract`,
`strategy.commission.cash_per_order`, `strategy.commission.percent`,
fixed-tick slippage, and fixed-tick limit verification, and has no other
commission modes, richer fill models, margin,
percent sizing, currency conversion,
unmatched missing-entry future binding, entry-relative pending-entry exit
attachment, or pyramiding. The only multiple-pending
reservation subset is explicit fixed `qty` or `qty_percent` single-trigger or
one-downside/one-upside bracket or trailing `strategy.exit` calls for the
current matching long entry.

Strategy-mode scripts can read `strategy.position_size`,
`strategy.position_avg_price`, `strategy.initial_capital`,
`strategy.openprofit`, `strategy.openprofit_percent`, `strategy.netprofit`,
`strategy.grossprofit`, `strategy.grossloss`, `strategy.avg_trade`,
`strategy.avg_winning_trade`, `strategy.avg_losing_trade`,
`strategy.buy_and_hold_return_percent`, `strategy.max_runup`,
`strategy.max_drawdown`, and
`strategy.equity` as historical series floats. They can also read `strategy.closedtrades` and
`strategy.opentrades` as historical series ints in the current count-only
reporting subset. `strategy.position_entry_name` is a historical series string.
`strategy.account_currency` is a read-only simple string that inherits the
current fixed symbol currency under the default `currency.NONE` path. Direct,
UDF, and history reads are supported without expanding public strategy JSON;
indicator use, requested-context use, and mutation remain unsupported. An
explicit `currency.NONE` declaration is accepted; other currency settings and
cross-currency conversion remain unsupported. The same-currency conversion
helpers follow the identity behavior described above.
`strategy.position_size` is `0` when flat, positive while long, and negative
while short.
`strategy.position_avg_price` is `na` when flat and the current average entry
price while long. `strategy.position_entry_name` is `na` while flat and holds
the entry order ID that initially opened the current continuous net position.
Pyramiding additions and partial allocation closes preserve it; the broker
clears it only when the net position becomes flat, allowing the next position
to establish a new name. `strategy.initial_capital` returns the configured or
default broker starting capital unchanged on every bar, including through UDF
and history reads, without expanding public strategy JSON. `strategy.openprofit`
is `(close - avg_price) * size` while
long and `0` when flat. `strategy.openprofit_percent` divides that value by
realized equity (`initial_capital + strategy.netprofit`) and multiplies by 100;
it returns `na` when the realized-equity denominator is non-positive or
non-finite. `strategy.netprofit` sums realized closed-trade profit.
`strategy.grossprofit` sums only positive realized closed-trade profit, so
losing, flat, and current open trades do not change it.
`strategy.grossloss` sums realized closed-trade losses as positive values, so
winning, flat, and current open trades do not change it.
`strategy.buy_and_hold_return_percent` returns the current close's percentage
change from the first loaded bar close and returns `na` when that first close is
zero or non-finite.
`strategy.avg_trade` returns `strategy.netprofit / strategy.closedtrades` once
at least one trade is closed, and `na` before the first closed trade.
`strategy.avg_winning_trade` returns the average realized profit among winning
closed trades only, and `na` before the first winning closed trade.
`strategy.avg_losing_trade` returns the average realized loss among losing
closed trades only as a positive value, and `na` before the first losing closed
trade.
`strategy.max_drawdown` returns the maximum intrabar equity drawdown amount
over the current supported trading interval, using the supported entry equity,
the maximum equity before that entry, and the lowest low reached while the
supported position is open. It returns `0`
before any drawdown from the maximum equity baseline.
`strategy.max_drawdown_percent` divides the supported drawdown amount by entry
price times current supported position quantity and multiplies by 100.
`strategy.max_runup` returns the maximum intrabar equity run-up
amount over the current supported long-only trading interval, using the
supported entry equity, the minimum equity before that entry, and the highest
high reached while the supported position is open. `strategy.max_runup_percent`
divides the supported run-up amount by entry price times current supported
position quantity and multiplies by 100.
`strategy.equity` is cash plus current market value; without configured
commission this equals `initial_capital + strategy.netprofit +
strategy.openprofit`, and with supported commission it also includes entry
commission debits on open positions. Supported slippage changes entry and exit
fill prices, so realized/floating profit and equity use those adjusted fill
prices. `strategy.closedtrades` is the
number of closed trades recorded by the broker.
`strategy.closedtrades.first_index` is the oldest retained closed-trade index;
it remains `0`, including before the first close, because the current broker
does not trim its closed-trade ledger. Platform order-limit trimming is outside
this slice. `strategy.wintrades`,
`strategy.losstrades`, and
`strategy.eventrades` count closed trades whose realized profit is positive,
negative, or zero. `strategy.opentrades` is `1` while the supported long
position is open and `0` when flat. Supported market `strategy.entry` fills at the next historical bar open before
script statements on that fill bar. Supported `strategy.close` and
`strategy.close_all` calls place market close orders that fill at the next
historical bar open, so later statements on the signal bar still see the
pre-fill strategy state. Const/simple `immediately=true` fills that close at
the current bar close through the scheduler current-tick market phase after the
command is placed, so later statements on the same bar see the filled close.
Series or non-bool `immediately` remains rejected.
Const bool `process_orders_on_close=true` fills eligible market
`strategy.entry`, `strategy.order`, `strategy.close`, and `strategy.close_all`
intents at the creation bar close after script statements, so script-visible
state on that bar remains pre-fill while public trades and equity include the
fill. `immediately=true` still fills during the close command. Const bool
`calc_on_order_fills=true` re-executes strategy statements after a historical
fill, refreshes live `strategy.*` state for that extra pass, resumes the
current bar's remaining path from the fill mark rather than restarting at
open, and can fill price-based entries placed on that pass on later ticks of
the same bar. Series history, plots, and `ta.*` state are restored to the bar-start
checkpoint before each extra pass so they do not consume an extra bar;
`var` persists across extra passes. Extra passes are bounded by the internal
recalculation-pass guardrail. Const bool `calc_on_every_tick=true` executes strategy statements on each
host-provided forming update, using the 21c confirmed-checkpoint replay:
`var` rolls back from confirmed state, `varip` persists across forming
updates, and abandoned forming orders, fills, alerts, plots, and drawings
do not leak into the confirmed result. Default `calc_on_every_tick=false`
does not execute strategy code on forming updates; the confirmed update
runs the bar once. Historical bars are unchanged by this setting because
they have no host-provided realtime ticks.
Bar magnifier lower-timeframe data is a host-owned MagnifierInputV1 envelope
(`schemaVersion` 1, zero-based `chartBars` groups). CLI `--magnifier-bars`,
Python `magnifier_bars`, and WASM `$magnifier` share one decoder. Named const
bool `use_bar_magnifier=true` is accepted for v5/v6 historical fill wiring.
When coverage exists, each lower-timeframe bar walks the existing Stage 18g
OHLC or OLHC path through the unified broker candidate selector. Public fill,
order, trade, and alert `bar_index` and `time` stay chart-bar scoped; the
public event timestamp is the chart-bar time. The first tradable open of a
covered chart bar is that group's first lower-bar open. A previous host close
that differs from the next host open — including ordinary chart-to-chart bars
and the last lower bar of one chart bar to the first lower bar of the next —
is a point event at that next open, not a tradable close-to-open segment.
Price orders are therefore tested for direction-aware marketability at that
open; a stop-limit cannot reuse a pre-activation gap price, and trailing
activation/ratchet transitions occur before any later stop fill. Pending
market orders still fill once on the pre-script open path. When previous
close equals next open, the inferred OHLC/OLHC path still fills at the
trigger. `calc_on_order_fills` extra passes resume from the
unconsumed lower-bar/path cursor and do not replay consumed marks. Missing
groups emit `W_MAGNIFIER_FALLBACK` and empty groups emit `W_MAGNIFIER_GAP`, both
falling back to that chart bar's standard OHLC path. Invalid host input fails
closed before bar-zero execution with
`E_MAGNIFIER_DUPLICATE_CHART_BAR`, `E_MAGNIFIER_DUPLICATE_TICK`,
`E_MAGNIFIER_UNSORTED_TICKS`, `E_MAGNIFIER_MAX_INTRABARS`,
`E_MAGNIFIER_INVALID_BAR`, `E_MAGNIFIER_CHART_BAR_RANGE`,
`E_MAGNIFIER_CHART_BAR_COUNT_REQUIRED`, `E_MAGNIFIER_SCHEMA_VERSION`,
`E_MAGNIFIER_MALFORMED`, or `E_MAGNIFIER_FORMING_BAR`. Complete-slice batch
APIs derive the range automatically. One-bar incremental and realtime-history
callers with non-empty magnifier input must call
`prepare_magnifier_chart_bar_count` before bar zero. Setting false or omitted
leaves supplied magnifier input inert. Forming/live realtime bars never consume
historical magnifier groups. `calc_on_every_history_tick` remains unimplemented
and rejected.
`fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc` remains unsupported. Public RuntimeResult
schemaVersion stays 8. Python `REALTIME_SESSION_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 1, with
optional seed-only `magnifier_bars`.
Internal broker state keeps `StrategyRiskRules` configuration separate from
`StrategyRiskState` tripped/window state, with hooks before order admission,
after fill, at intraday-window reset, and before forced close.
Intraday windows are keyed from host-neutral bar timestamps and the chart
timeframe already available to the runtime: UTC day of `time` when the chart
timeframe is at or below 1D, and the bar timestamp itself when the timeframe
is higher than 1D so one chart bar is one window. Non-positive timeframes fail
closed to the UTC-day key. Optional host session window input replaces those
UTC keys with per-bar `windowId` for intraday loss/filled-order rules and
`tradingDayId` for consecutive-loss-day rules. Missing input keeps the UTC
subset and does not claim session-accurate support. This runtime does not
maintain an exchange calendar. A new window
zeros the filled-order count, seeds a finite equity baseline, and clears
window-scoped trips while permanent `max_drawdown` stops remain. Same-window
bars keep the baseline and counters; a missing-bar gap starts a new window.
`strategy.risk.allow_entry_in` accepts documented `strategy.direction.*`
constants and rewrites later `strategy.entry` admission: allowed directions
keep current open, add, and reversal behavior; a disallowed opposite entry
against an open allowed position flattens without opening prohibited
exposure; a disallowed opposite entry while flat is a no-op; last call wins;
pending opposite `strategy.entry` intents are cancelled while flat or
converted to market close-only against an open allowed position.
`strategy.order` is not bound by this rule.
`strategy.risk.max_position_size` accepts simple positive finite numeric
contracts and clamps later `strategy.entry` quantity so projected post-fill
exposure does not exceed the limit. Remaining room of zero is a no-op.
Opposite `strategy.entry` reversal flattens first, then opens at most the
limit on the new side. Pending `strategy.entry` quantities are reduced when
the rule is recorded or when they fill. `strategy.order` is not bound by
this rule.
`strategy.risk.max_drawdown` accepts simple positive finite numeric `value`
with required `strategy.cash` or `strategy.percent_of_equity`. Cash compares
peak-equity drawdown amount, including open adverse excursion from bar
high/low. Percent compares that amount to maximum equity and also trips when
equity is non-positive. Evaluation runs after historical fills, after trade
extremes, after margin evaluation, and after post-script fills. On trigger
the broker cancels all pending orders, flattens through a risk-owned market
close at the evaluation mark, and permanently sets blocked order placement.
Intraday-window reset keeps that tripped stop.
`strategy.risk.max_intraday_loss` accepts simple positive finite numeric
`value` with required `strategy.cash` or `strategy.percent_of_equity`. Loss is
maximum window equity minus mark-to-market equity, including open adverse
excursion. Percent also trips when equity is non-positive. On trigger the
broker cancels pending orders, flattens, and blocks later trades until the
next intraday window.
`strategy.risk.max_intraday_filled_orders` accepts a simple positive finite
integer count. Each public filled order in the window increments the counter.
On reaching the limit the broker cancels pending orders, flattens after the
committed fill, and blocks later trades until the next window.
`strategy.risk.max_cons_loss_days` accepts a simple positive finite integer
count. Each completed window with negative realized closed-trade profit counts
as a loss day. A profitable or no-trade window resets the streak; a missing-bar
gap does not insert a no-trade window. After `count` consecutive observed loss
windows the broker cancels pending orders, flattens leftover exposure at the
new window's bar open, and permanently blocks later trades. Remaining
undocumented `strategy.risk.*` calls stay rejected.
Forming-bar realtime updates with `calc_on_every_tick=true` re-execute from
the last confirmed checkpoint.
After seeding `varip` from the previous forming update, the runtime restores
the confirmed broker checkpoint (order book, OCA, reservations, ledger, cash,
fill alerts, and script alerts) and commits broker plus output state only on
the confirmed update. Abandoned forming placements, cancellations, stop-limit
activations, fills, and alerts do not leak into the confirmed result.
Historical price-based fills on a bar run through a deterministic fill-path:
market closes and entries at open, then the selected open-high-low-close or
open-low-high-close walk. Same-tick pyramiding still fills every eligible
order at the same path mark. Limit and stop entries that are both eligible on
the same bar fill in path-crossing order, then creation sequence, rather than
a long-then-short family rank. Pending `strategy.exit`
fills are evaluated on that same pre-script path, so script reads observe the
count changes on the fill bar while public strategy output and equity include
the fill on the triggering bar. These variables can be used
in the same already-supported expression contexts as other series values,
including branches, switches, loops, pure UDF arguments, and constant history
references. Their history follows the normal per-expression series history
model. Direct mutation such as `strategy.position_size := ...`,
`strategy.account_currency := ...`, `strategy.position_entry_name := ...`,
`strategy.closedtrades := ...`, or
`strategy.closedtrades.first_index := ...`
is rejected because strategy state variables are read-only.
The first supported closed-trade namespace functions are
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(trade_num)`,
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_price(trade_num)`,
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index(trade_num)`, and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index(trade_num)`. Stage 7 Slice 1 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.size(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.profit(trade_num)`. Stage 7 Slice 2 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_time(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_time(trade_num)`. Stage 7 Slice 3 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.commission(trade_num)`, which returns `0.0` without
configured commission and supported entry-plus-exit commission when configured.
Stage 7
Slice 4 adds `strategy.closedtrades.entry_id(trade_num)`, which returns the
entry id already retained on the closed trade record. Stage 7 Slice 5 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_id(trade_num)`, which returns the close or
`strategy.exit` id retained on the closed trade record. Strategy trade comment
helpers add `strategy.closedtrades.entry_comment(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment(trade_num)` for commented fixture-backed
trades; invalid, out-of-range, or uncommented reads return `na`, and comments
remain internal script-visible metadata rather than public strategy JSON
fields. Stage 7 Slice 15 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.max_runup(trade_num)`, returning the largest high-based
favorable excursion retained for the selected closed trade quantity. The
current long-only closed-trade field subset reads fixture-backed pyramided
closed trades by zero-based index. Stage 7 Slice 16
adds `strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown(trade_num)`, returning the largest
low-based adverse excursion retained for the selected closed trade quantity. Stage 7
Slice 17 adds cash-per-contract commission accounting for supported entries and
exits without adding public schema fields. Stage 7 Slice 18 adds cash-per-order
commission accounting under the same public contract. Stage 7 Slice 19 adds
fixed-tick slippage to supported long entry, close, and exit fill prices
without changing trigger conditions or public schema. Stage 7 Slice 20 adds
fixed-tick limit-order verification for supported long limit entry and
supported long limit/profit exit fills while preserving the original limit fill
price. Stage 7 Slice 21 adds percent commission accounting for supported
entry/exit fills under the same public contract. Stage 7 Slice 22 adds
`strategy.grossprofit` as a script-visible read-only series float over the
closed-trade list without changing public output shape. Stage 7 Slice 23 adds
`strategy.grossloss` under the same public-output contract. Stage 7 Slice 24
adds `strategy.avg_trade` under the same public-output contract. Stage 7 Slice
25 adds `strategy.avg_winning_trade` under the same public-output contract.
Stage 7 Slice 26 adds `strategy.avg_losing_trade` under the same public-output
contract. Stage 7 Slice 27 adds `strategy.max_drawdown` under the same
public-output contract. Stage 7 Slice 28 adds `strategy.max_runup` under the
same public-output contract. Stage 7 Slice 32 adds
`strategy.netprofit_percent`, `strategy.grossprofit_percent`, and
`strategy.grossloss_percent` under the same public-output contract, using
`amount / initial_capital * 100`. Stage 7 Slice 33 adds
`strategy.avg_trade_percent`, `strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent`, and
`strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent` under the same public-output contract,
averaging per-closed-trade percentage profit/loss values using each trade's
entry value as denominator. These state variables read the current closed-trade
list and are script-observable only through ordinary series outputs; they do
not add public runtime JSON, Python, or WASM fields. Stage 7 Slice 34 adds
`strategy.max_contracts_held_all`, `strategy.max_contracts_held_long`, and
`strategy.max_contracts_held_short` under the same public-output contract; in
the current subset, `long` tracks the maximum filled long-entry quantity,
`short` tracks the maximum filled market short-entry quantity, and `all` is
the max of those two values. Closed/open trade namespace
functions read the current trade lists with a zero-based integer `trade_num`;
missing, negative, out-of-range, or non-integer indexes return `na`.
Stage 7 Slice 6 adds `strategy.opentrades.entry_price(trade_num)` for the
current supported long position. It returns the current open position average
entry price for `trade_num == 0`; when flat, out of range, negative, or
non-integer, it returns `na`. Stage 7 Slice 7 adds
`strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index(trade_num)` under the same contract,
returning the current open position's entry fill bar. Stage 7 Slice 8 adds
`strategy.opentrades.entry_time(trade_num)`, returning the current open
position's entry fill timestamp. Stage 7 Slice 9 adds
`strategy.opentrades.size(trade_num)`, returning the current open position
size. Stage 7 Slice 10 adds `strategy.opentrades.profit(trade_num)`, returning
the current close-based floating profit for the current open position. Stage 7
Slice 11 adds `strategy.opentrades.entry_id(trade_num)`, returning the retained
entry id for that open position. Stage 7 Slice 12 adds
`strategy.opentrades.commission(trade_num)`, returning `0.0` for the selected
open trade without configured commission and the selected open trade's
supported entry commission when configured. Stage 7 Slice 13 adds
`strategy.opentrades.max_runup(trade_num)`, returning the largest high-based
favorable excursion seen so far for the selected open trade. Stage 7 Slice 14 adds
`strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown(trade_num)`, returning the largest low-based
adverse excursion seen so far for the selected open trade. Strategy trade comment
helpers add `strategy.opentrades.entry_comment(trade_num)` for commented
fixture-backed open trades. The current long-only open-trade field subset reads
fixture-backed pyramided open trades by zero-based index; invalid, out-of-range,
flat-state, or uncommented reads return `na`, with no public strategy JSON
expansion. Other open-trade namespace functions and public open-trade record
output remain unsupported.
The indexed trade-percentage slice adds
`strategy.closedtrades.profit_percent`,
`strategy.closedtrades.max_runup_percent`,
`strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown_percent`, and the matching three
`strategy.opentrades.*` functions. Each divides the selected signed profit or
non-negative excursion amount by `entry_price * abs(quantity)` and multiplies
by 100. The functions return `na` for the same invalid, non-integer,
out-of-range, or flat-state indexes as their amount counterparts, and also for
a non-positive or non-finite entry value. They reuse the internal long-only
trade ledger and do not expand public strategy JSON.
Stage 7 Slice 35 adds `strategy.opentrades.capital_held` as the one variable
inside the open-trade namespace. In the current no-margin subset it returns
`na`; with explicit active `margin_long`, Stage 7 Margin Slice M2 returns the
current supported open long position's market value times `margin_long / 100`,
or `0.0` while flat. Stage 7 Margin Slice M3 applies the same active
`margin_long` account model to supported long entry affordability at the actual
fill price. Stage 7 Margin Slice M5 applies the long-only forced-liquidation
subset, so `capital_held` reflects the remaining open long position after a
margin call. Stage 15a applies explicit active `margin_short` to short
`capital_held` and supported short-entry affordability at the actual fill
price. Stage 15b force-liquidates underwater shorts at `bar.high` using the
documented four-times-cover algorithm, so `capital_held` reflects the remaining
open short position after a margin call. Stage 15c exposes
`strategy.margin_liquidation_price` for active short margin as
`cash / (abs(position_size) * (1 + margin_short / 100))`.
`strategy.margin_liquidation_price` uses the supported long and short margin
account models. For longs it solves
`equity_value(price) == position_size * price * margin_long / 100` and returns
`na` without active long margin, while flat, or for the unattainable
`margin_long=100` divisor. For shorts it returns `na` without active short
margin or while flat. It does not round to `syminfo.mintick` yet and does not
expose a public margin schema field.

The strategy contract is host-independent and exposed consistently by CLI JSON,
Python dictionaries, and WASM JSON. Fixture-backed market-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=...)`, or omitted-qty long orders using
the configured default quantity, fill on the next historical bar open and can
add to an existing long position without using the `strategy.entry()`
pyramiding limit. Fixture-backed limit-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., limit=price)` orders use the
supported long limit timing model, fill at the verified limit price on a later
historical bar, and also bypass the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit;
omitted long `qty` uses the configured default quantity at placement time.
Fixture-backed limit-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., limit=price)` orders use the
supported short limit timing model, fill at the verified limit price on a later
historical bar when `high >= limit`, and apply signed netting without using the
`strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit. Explicit positive `qty` is required.
Fixture-backed stop-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., stop=price)` orders use the
supported short stop timing model, fill at the stop price on a later historical
bar when `low <= stop`, open or increase short exposure while flat or already
short without using the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit, and apply signed netting after stop trigger selection. Explicit positive `qty` is required.
Fixture-backed stop-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., stop=price)` orders use the
supported long stop timing model, fill at the stop price on a later historical
bar, and also bypass the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit; omitted long
`qty` uses the configured default quantity at placement time.
Fixture-backed stop-limit-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., stop=stop_price, limit=limit_price)`
orders use the supported long stop-limit model: activation occurs when the
path visits a price at or above the stop, and a high-first bar may fill the
limit on the same bar after activation when the path visits a price at or
below the limit or below the configured verified limit threshold. They also
bypass the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit; omitted long `qty` uses the
configured default quantity at placement time.
Fixture-backed stop-limit-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., stop=stop_price, limit=limit_price)`
orders use the supported short stop-limit model: activation occurs when the
path visits a price at or below the stop, and the limit fill stays fail-closed
until a later historical bar when the path visits a price at or above the
limit or above the configured verified limit threshold. They open or increase
short exposure while flat or already short without using the `strategy.entry()`
pyramiding limit, and apply signed netting after stop activation and a later
limit fill. Explicit positive `qty` is required.
Fixture-backed market
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=...)` and
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=...)` orders apply signed netting on the
next historical bar open, independent of the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding
limit. Filled signed quantity `D` against position `P` yields target `P+D`:
flat-to-side, same-side increase, opposite partial reduction, exact flatten, or
cross-zero remainder open. Public order quantity is `|D|`. Close quantity is
`min(|P|,|D|)` when `D` opposes `P`. Long orders use long-entry slippage; short
orders use short-entry slippage. An unaffordable open remainder rejects the
whole fill. Limit generic orders reuse that signed netting after later-bar
trigger selection at the verified limit price. Stop generic orders reuse that
signed netting after stop trigger selection. Stop-limit generic orders reuse it
after activation on a later bar and a subsequent limit fill. Price-based
`strategy.entry()` limit, stop, and stop-limit reversals flatten opposite
exposure then open the requested quantity; pyramiding applies to the new side,
not the flatten quantity. Same-id generic-order replacement updates pending
market, limit, stop, and stop-limit `strategy.order` intents of the same
direction; opposite-direction same-id replacement cancels the old intent then
places the new one. `strategy.cancel(id)` clears matching pending generic
orders, pending exits, deferred relative exits, and pending closes, including
when those families share a public id. Generic-order reductions allocate FIFO, or
id-specific ANY when `close_entries_rule` is ANY and the order id matches an
open entry; unmatched ANY stays FIFO. Const/simple `oca_name` with explicit
`strategy.oca.none` keeps grouped `strategy.entry` and `strategy.order`
intents independent. `strategy.oca.cancel` cancels still-pending same-group
entry and generic-order peers after a fill, in internal creation order, and
leaves unrelated groups in place. `strategy.oca.reduce` reduces same-group
peer remaining quantity by the filled quantity and removes peers reduced to
zero, including mixed entry, generic-order, and exit members that share the
same name and reduce type. Const/simple `strategy.exit` `oca_name` maps onto
that implicit reduce reservation model: grouped exits share overlapping
quantity, and a fill reduces same-group peers. Same name with different OCA
types remains two groups. Empty `oca_name` does not join a group. OCA peer
effects from an entry fill apply before deferred relative exits for that
entry are resolved.
Omitted `qty` remains unsupported for `strategy.short`.
The supported `strategy.order()` subset accepts
`comment`, `alert_message`, and `disable_alert` metadata. Supported long order
fills retain entry comments, short reduction/flatten/cross-zero fills retain
exit comments, and supported order-fill alert payloads are exposed under
`strategy.alerts`; the metadata does not widen unsupported order shapes.
`strategy.exit` variants beyond the
supported single-trigger, one-downside/one-upside bracket, trailing-stop,
fixed-quantity, percent-quantity, explicit single-trigger or bracket/trailing
reservation subset, `strategy.cancel(id)`, and `strategy.cancel_all()`,
series `oca_name` `strategy.entry`, `strategy.order`, and `strategy.exit` forms,
rich order families, strategy reporting helpers beyond the supported
position/profit/equity/count/run-up/drawdown/buy-and-hold return variables,
requested-context strategy state, strategy state mutation, and realtime
strategy handoff remain unsupported until later strategy-maintenance slices
define and fixture those semantics. Phase M
adds narrow stop-only `strategy.exit(id, from_entry, stop=price)` and limit-only
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, limit=price)` subsets for the current
one-net-long broker. Stage 14f extends those absolute stop/limit exits to
matching market short entries: a short stop fills when `high >= stop`, a short
limit fills when `low <= limit` minus the configured verification offset, and
cover fills use short-exit slippage with signed closed-trade quantity.
Stage 14g converts short `profit=ticks` to a limit below the matching short
entry price and short `loss=ticks` to a stop above it. Stage 14h accepts the
same four one-downside/one-upside brackets on matching shorts; the stop/loss
leg fills on `high >= stop`, the limit/profit leg fills on
`low <= limit` minus verification offset, and both-touch prefers stop/loss.
Stage 14i trailing shorts activate when `low <= activation`, persist
`low + offset` as the active stop without filling that bar, ratchet that stop
downward only, and fill later when `high >= active_stop`. Phase N adds profit-only
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, profit=ticks)` and loss-only
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, loss=ticks)` helpers. Phase R adds the first
bracket subset: exactly one downside leg plus one upside leg, covering
`stop + limit`, `stop + profit`, `loss + limit`, and `loss + profit`. Phase S
adds the first trailing subset: exactly `trail_price + trail_offset` and
`trail_points + trail_offset`. Phase U adds optional fixed `qty`; Phase V adds
optional `qty_percent` on those same supported trigger shapes. Stage 4 accepts
`qty` and `qty_percent` together on those same supported trigger shapes, with
fixed `qty` determining the reserved or filled quantity. Quantity forms evaluate
once at placement time, must be finite and positive, and store an absolute
requested close quantity on the single pending exit. When only `qty_percent` is
used, it resolves against the current open position size as
`position_size * qty_percent / 100.0`, and values above 100 are allowed because
fills clamp to the current position size. Omitted `qty` and omitted
`qty_percent` keep the previous full-position behavior.

Profit/loss and trailing tick arguments convert positive tick distances from
`strategy.position_avg_price` using the fixed default `syminfo.mintick`, then
reuse the same pending-exit lifecycle: accepted calls are not eligible on the
bar where they are created or replaced, and a later historical bar with
`low <= stop/loss price` or `high >= limit/profit price` fills at the selected
exit price. Configured limit-order verification requires supported long
limit/profit exit fills to move the configured number of ticks beyond the
limit/profit price while still filling at the original limit/profit price.
Configured slippage worsens the supported long exit fill price after trigger
selection without changing trigger conditions. Single-trigger, bracket, and
trailing exits with explicit fixed
`qty` or `qty_percent` can keep multiple pending reservations for different
identities and share one reservation pool for the current matching long entry.
Same-side touched candidates fill in placement order. When downside
stop/loss/trailing candidates and upside limit/profit candidates are both
touched on the same eligible bar, only downside candidates fill on that bar in
placement order; opposite-side candidates remain pending if a long position
remains. If both legs of one bracket are touched on the same eligible bar, that
bracket contributes its downside stop/loss candidate. Omitted-quantity
full-position exits still use one-effective-pending replacement behavior across
supported single-trigger, bracket, and trailing forms, even when the
replacement uses a different `id + from_entry` identity. A later omitted
full-position exit clears earlier explicit fixed-`qty` or `qty_percent`
reservations for the current matching long entry. A trailing exit activates on
a later eligible bar when
`high >= activation_price`, sets its active stop to `high - offset_distance`,
and does not fill on the activation bar. On later bars, an active trailing exit
fills first when `low <= active_stop`; otherwise the active stop ratchets upward
and never decreases. When an inactive trailing reservation activates on the same
bar where an upside reservation fills, the trailing reservation persists its
active state and does not contribute a fill candidate until a later bar. A
filled exit appends exactly one `strategy.exit` order event with the absolute
filled quantity, records a closed trade under the source entry id for that
quantity, reduces or clears the current long position, and updates the normal
position/equity snapshots. Phase M, Phase N, Phase R, Phase S, Phase U, Phase V,
Phase W, Phase X, Phase Y, and Phase Z do not add public pending-order records,
reservation fields, remaining-quantity fields, percent fields, bracket-leg
metadata, trailing-state fields, activation fields, exit reason fields, or
top-level runtime schema fields.
Phase O does not add public
open-trade records. Stage 7 adds only script-visible closed-trade
`entry_id`, `exit_id`, `entry_price`, `exit_price`, `entry_bar_index`,
`exit_bar_index`, `entry_time`, `exit_time`, `commission`, `size`, `profit`,
`max_runup`, and `max_drawdown` namespace functions; it does not add public
trade-namespace fields. The prior Phase L
boundary is
summarized in
`docs/PHASE_L_AUDIT.md`; the closed Phase M and Phase N exit subsets are
summarized in `docs/PHASE_M_AUDIT.md` and `docs/PHASE_N_AUDIT.md`; the Phase R
bracket subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_R_AUDIT.md`; the Phase U fixed
quantity subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_U_AUDIT.md`; and the Phase V
percent quantity subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_V_AUDIT.md`; the Phase X
bracket reservation subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_X_AUDIT.md`; the Phase Y
trailing reservation subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_Y_AUDIT.md`; the Phase
Z omitted-quantity boundary is summarized in `docs/PHASE_Z_AUDIT.md`.

## Runtime Errors

`runtime.error(message)` accepts a string-compatible message and returns
`void`. The call is evaluated only when ordinary control flow reaches it. Once
reached, its argument is evaluated and the runtime immediately returns an
error carrying the exact string; no later statement or bar is executed. This
propagation is unchanged through nested user-defined-function calls. A
string-compatible `na` argument produces the deterministic message `NaN`,
consistent with existing runtime string rendering. Non-string arguments are
rejected during semantic analysis, and the `void` result cannot initialize a
declaration or feed a value-consuming built-in.

The error is an internal execution outcome, not an alert, log event, output
snapshot, or host callback. It therefore adds no public runtime-result schema
field and does not enter the output rollback or collection-mutation side-effect
models.

## Alert Events

`alertcondition(condition, title, message)` is a supported runtime side effect
for a narrow declarative subset. `condition` accepts bool-compatible values;
`false` and `na` do not emit an event. `title` and `message` must be const
strings. Runtime output serializes `title` as the alert event `source` and
`message` as the alert event `message` after replacing `{{open}}`, `{{high}}`,
`{{low}}`, `{{close}}`, and `{{volume}}` with triggering-bar values, plus
`{{ticker}}`, `{{interval}}`, and `{{exchange}}` with current chart metadata,
and `{{time}}` with the triggering bar timestamp using the UTC
`str.format_time` default format.

`alert(message, freq?)` is supported for string-compatible dynamic messages. It
serializes `source` as `alert`. The default frequency is
`alert.freq_once_per_bar`, which emits at most one event per alert callsite per
bar even if a loop reaches the same callsite multiple times. `alert.freq_all`
emits every reached call. `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close` emits at most one
event per alert callsite only when execution is for a historical bar or a
confirmed realtime bar update; forming realtime updates do not expose or commit
close-frequency alert events. TradingView-style `{{...}}` placeholder
interpolation outside supported `alertcondition` message placeholders and
other alert frequency values remain unsupported.

Alert conditions execute like ordinary reached statements in global flow,
including supported `if`, `switch`, `for`, and `while` bodies. This is a
deliberate runtime-event model for the current subset, not a global-only
declaration model. Multiple triggering alert sites on the same bar are emitted
in program order and use deterministic callsite ids.

Realtime forming updates expose alert events for the current forming result,
but those events are part of the forming runtime snapshot. A later forming
update starts again from the confirmed snapshot, so abandoned forming alert
events disappear. Only historical and confirmed updates become part of the
confirmed result.

Alert side effects inside user-defined functions, user-defined function
arguments, and requested-context expressions are rejected under the same
side-effect boundary as output calls, drawing calls, input declarations, and
array mutation.

## Libraries And Imports

Imports are resolved before runtime execution. Hosts may provide exact-key
library source text to semantic analysis; the core builds a deterministic
source graph, validates library declarations and aliases, then lowers the root
program. Exported const expressions are inlined into the root, and exported pure
functions lower through the same inlined UDF machinery as local functions.
Runtime execution receives one lowered HIR program and performs no filesystem,
network, registry, or library lookup.

The executable import subset supports scalar-tree imported UDT constructors,
direct and nested field reads, ordinary same-imported-UDT reassignment, and scalar-tree
imported UDT typed declarations, same-imported-identity ternary results, plus
same-imported-identity `if`, `switch`, `while`, and `for` expression results,
direct or nested UDF parameter passthrough and direct or nested constructor-return
results, ordinary imported UDT `var` declarations, and scalar-tree root-field replacement in
top-level, branch, `for`-loop, `while`-loop, and UDF-local statement contexts,
by lowering them to ordinary UDT field-vector values with source-scoped HIR
identity. It also supports scalar-tree imported UDT `varip` declarations
through the same intrabar value-clone slot model as local scalar-tree UDT
`varip`, plus receiver-style or alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT method calls
including direct same-identity, block-local alias, final-if alias, final-for
alias, final-while alias, switch-expression alias, nested-method passthrough
plus constructor returns, and method-local
scalar-tree root-field replacement, plus scalar-tree imported UDT value history and `array.from`
size/get/first/last, set replacement field reads, push append field reads,
unshift prepend field reads, insert insertion field reads, fill replacement
field reads, join positional stringification, includes/indexof/lastindexof
structural equality search, sort/sort_indices by the default root field or a
compile-time int-index/string-name selector resolving to an int/float/string field,
pop/remove/shift return field reads, clear size reset, copy independent field
reads, reverse reordered field reads, slice window field reads, concat appended
field reads, and statement/expression/index-value for-in value-copy field reads.
It intentionally excludes remote lookup, re-exports, unaliased imports,
side-effecting exported functions, imported UDT flow outside the covered same-identity scalar-tree paths, collections,
direct private imported UDT access and imported UDT value history outside the scalar-tree metadata subset, and alias-qualified imported method receiver type
mismatches.

## String Literals

Single-line string literals may use Pine's deprecated physical-line wrapping
syntax. Every continuation line must begin with at least one ASCII space; the
lexer removes the physical line terminator and collapses all leading spaces on
that continuation line to one space in the resulting string. This applies to
both quotation-mark and apostrophe delimiters and does not emit layout tokens.
An unindented physical line break still terminates recovery with
`E_LEX_STRING`.

All single-line, line-wrapped, and triple-delimited literals share Pine's
40,960-character maximum. The lexer counts the decoded string value in Unicode
scalar characters after escape decoding, line-wrap collapsing, and multiline
line-ending normalization. It accepts exactly 40,960 characters. A longer
literal reports `E_LEX_STRING_LIMIT` over the complete delimited span while
retaining the token so later statements do not receive cascading parse errors.

## Expression Line Wrapping

### Parenthesized Wrapping

While one or more round parentheses remain open, the lexer treats physical
line endings and all indentation at the next non-comment line as layout-free
whitespace. This allows grouped expressions, function calls, and function
parameter declarations to wrap with zero or more spaces, including multiples
of four, and permits comments between wrapped parts. Nested parentheses share
the same rule. Once the matching outer parenthesis closes, ordinary newline and
indent/dedent emission resumes, preserving surrounding local-block structure.
If a parenthesized expression contains an `if`, `for`, `while`, or `switch`
block expression, that enclosing parenthesis temporarily retains structural
newlines and indentation until it closes so the nested block remains parseable.

### Legacy Wrapping Outside Parentheses

Outside round parentheses, a physical line continues the current expression
when its leading indentation is deeper than the active local block and its
expanded column is not a multiple of four. Spaces advance one column and tabs
advance four columns. The lexer omits the preceding newline and the
continuation indentation, including after an end-of-line comment. Successive
continuations may use different eligible indentation widths. This applies to
global and local expressions, including arithmetic, ternaries, string
concatenation, UDF bodies, and reassignment. A continuation starting at a
multiple-of-four column remains structural layout and is therefore rejected
when an unfinished expression precedes it.

## Variables

### Normal Declarations

Normal declarations are evaluated when their scope is evaluated on each bar.

```pine
x = close + open
```

`x` receives a new current value on every bar where the declaration executes.
The value can be committed into its series history after the bar execution.
Normal and tuple declarations inside `if` blocks are scoped to the branch. If
the branch is skipped, branch-local series slots commit `na` for that bar.

When an `if` is used as a declaration value, both branches must end with a
value-producing expression. Void side-effect calls such as `alert()` are not
valid branch results, and neither are trailing declarations or reassignment
statements.

For v6 scripts, `and` and `or` use lazy evaluation: the right operand is skipped
when the left operand already determines the result. Earlier-version scripts
keep strict operand evaluation for this runtime's legacy subset.

`for i = start to end` loops over an inclusive integer range. The runtime
increments when `start <= end` and decrements when `start > end`. An explicit
non-zero int `by step` supplies the absolute step magnitude; the sign of `step`
does not override the range direction. `start` and `step` are evaluated once
when the loop statement is reached on a bar. In v6 scripts, `end` is
re-evaluated before each iteration; earlier-version scripts evaluate `end` once
when the loop is reached. If `start`, `end`, or `step` evaluates to `na`, the
loop body is skipped. The counter is scoped to the loop body. `break` exits the
nearest enclosing loop. `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and
advances to the next loop counter value.

When a `for` loop is used as a declaration value, the loop body must end with a
value-producing expression. Void side-effect calls such as `alert()` are not
valid loop results. The loop returns the last value produced by the final
expression. A trailing `break` or `continue` statement is not a result
expression, and neither are trailing declarations or reassignment statements.
If a `continue` skips the expression or a `break` exits before it, the previous
produced value remains the loop result. If no iteration reaches the expression,
the loop result is `na`.

Statement-form `for value in values` currently supports only `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, and `array<color>` iterables.
The iterable expression is evaluated once, the initial array length is captured,
and the runtime visits indexes `0..initial_len`. Each element is read from
current array storage when its index is reached and assigned by value to the
loop-local variable. Empty arrays and typed `na` array iterables execute zero
iterations. `break` exits the nearest enclosing loop, `continue` skips the rest
of the current iteration, loop-body local declarations are scoped like other
loop bodies, and stateful built-in calls in the body advance at each reached
iteration for that callsite. `break` or `continue` outside a loop is rejected
with `E_LOOP_CONTROL`. Mutations through any alias affect not-yet-visited
existing indexes. Appended elements are not visited in the current loop. If the
array shrinks so a future initial index is out of bounds, execution raises the
same runtime error used by `array.get`. Label, line, linefill, polyline, box,
and table array loop values are shallow-copied ids, so drawing setters or lifecycle
operations through the loop local mutate the same drawing object while
assignment to the loop local does not write the source array slot. Chart-point
array and same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array loop values are
copied into the loop-local variable, so local field mutation does not write back
to the source slot. The narrow `for index, value in values` form supports `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`,
`array<label>`, `array<line>`, `array<linefill>`, `array<polyline>`,
`array<box>`, `array<table>`, `array<chart.point>`, and same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree UDT array iterables with a zero-based `series int`
index loop-local. Statement-form `for...in` also supports runtime-owned
`matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and
`matrix<color>` iterables by capturing matrix rows at loop entry and binding
each loop value to an independent row snapshot array. The optional index/value
form exposes the zero-based row number as a `series int`; later matrix shape
changes inside the loop body do not change the rows visited during that
execution. Expression-form `for value in values` supports `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`,
`array<label>`, `array<line>`, `array<linefill>`, `array<polyline>`,
`array<box>`, `array<table>`, `array<chart.point>`, and same-local scalar-field
UDT array iterables, plus runtime-owned matrix row iterables and scalar map
iterables, and returns the last expression from the last completed iteration, or
`na` when the iterable is typed `na` or has zero rows/elements. Matrix
expression-form iteration uses the same independent row snapshots as
statement-form matrix iteration. For scalar maps, key-only forms bind the map key
to the loop value, while key/value forms bind the key to the first loop local and
the map value to the second loop local. The optional expression-form index local
is the same zero-based `series int` slot number used by statement-form
index/value iteration for arrays and matrix rows, and the map key for scalar
maps. `break` returns the previous expression result and `continue` skips the
current iteration's result expression. Index/value iteration over typed imported
or non-scalar-tree UDT arrays, expression-form `for...in` beyond the
scalar-array, drawing-id-array, chart.point-array, same-local scalar-tree
UDT-array, matrix-row, and scalar-map subset, non-array/non-matrix/non-map
iterables, and other non-scalar arrays remain outside the current subset.
When the iterable is a same-local scalar-tree UDT-array parameter of a local
UDF or typed local user method, lowering binds the value loop local with the
element identity resolved for that call. Value-only and index/value statement
loops, block-local aliases, and final expression-form loops may return a field
or other scalar result, the UDT element itself, or a same-identity UDT array
rebuilt from that element. Interleaved A-to-B-to-A UDF calls and named
typed-method arguments retain independent field layouts, returned-element
identities, and rebuilt-array identities.
Ordinary `var` scalar arrays roll back
loop-body mutation during repeated forming realtime updates, while scalar
typed-array `varip` iteration preserves carried intrabar loop-body mutation
between repeated forming updates. The scalar-array runtime fixtures,
label-array, line-array, linefill-array, polyline-array, box-array, and
table-array shallow-id fixtures, chart-point-array value-copy fixture, and
UDT-array value-copy fixture have explicit execution parity with full historical
recomputation.

`while condition` evaluates the condition before each iteration. A `true`
condition executes the body, while `false` or `na` exits the loop. `break`
exits the nearest enclosing loop. `continue` skips the remaining body statements
and re-evaluates the condition. Runtime execution enforces a maximum iteration
guard per while evaluation so non-terminating scripts fail instead of
hanging execution. `while` bodies follow ordinary statement expression rules,
including fixture-backed history reads and pure UDF calls. Scalar `while`
expressions return the latest reached final body expression, or `na` if no
iteration produces a value. Stateful callsites in reached expression bodies
advance per reached iteration, and body-local declarations including local
`var` declaration sites follow loop-local storage rules. When a while
expression is evaluated inside an outer loop, `break` and `continue` in the
expression body are consumed by the nearest while expression and do not control
the outer loop. Tuple declaration/destructuring from while-expression results
uses the same latest-produced-result rule. A while expression may return a
scalar array result, including a fresh array or an existing scalar-array alias;
callers may read or mutate that returned array with the supported scalar-array
APIs. Scalar-array zero-iteration `na`, result preservation across
break/continue, and fresh historical copies from committed history reads are
fixture-backed. While expressions can also return runtime-owned
`matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and
`matrix<color>` results; callers may read or mutate those returned matrix ids
with the supported matrix APIs. Nested collection interactions through
while-expression results remain outside this executable subset, and nested-array
while-expression results are rejected before runtime execution.
Same-imported-identity UDT while-expression results are supported;
local/imported mismatches are rejected before runtime execution.

`switch` expressions evaluate arms in source order. Selector-form switches
evaluate the selector once per bar, then compare each case expression with that
selector value. Selector-less switches evaluate each arm condition until one is
`true`. Only the selected result expression executes. For supported
statement-block arms, only the selected block's statements execute and its final
expression becomes the arm result. If no arm matches and no default arm exists,
the switch returns `na`. Same-imported-identity UDT switch results are
supported; imported/local or otherwise mismatched UDT switch results are
rejected before runtime execution.
Statement-context `switch` forms use the same arm-selection rules, execute only
the selected arm, and can perform side effects, outer reassignment, or propagate
loop control without requiring a final result expression.

### Reassignment

```pine
x := x + 1
```

Reassignment updates an existing variable in the current execution scope. The
semantic analyzer must reject reassignment to unknown names.

The scalar-variable compound assignment operators are exact shorthand for the
corresponding reassignment expression. For example, `x += value` has the same
type, qualifier, `na`, persistence, and runtime behavior as
`x := x + value`. The same normalization applies to `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and
`%=`, while string operands make `+=` use string concatenation.

### `var`

```pine
var x = 0
```

`var` declarations initialize once, then preserve state across bars. A `var`
inside a local block initializes the first time that declaration site is reached,
then reuses the same persistent slot on later executions of the block. Inlined
user-defined function bodies allocate independent persistent slots for each
syntactic callsite. The runtime stores this state separately from ordinary
per-bar locals.

For arrays, the stored value is a runtime-owned array id. A normal
`array.new_float`, `array.new_int`, `array.new_bool`, `array.new_string`,
`array.new_color`, `array.new_label`, `array.new_line`,
`array.new_linefill`, `array.new_box`, or `array.new_table` declaration
allocates a fresh array each time it executes. `array.new_label`,
`array.new_line`, `array.new_linefill`, `array.new_box`, and
`array.new_table` create drawing-id arrays filled with `na` when no initial id
is supplied.
`array.from` also allocates a fresh inferred typed array and requires at least
one non-`na` supported typed value, including label, line, linefill, box, and
table ids for drawing-id arrays. A `var` array declaration keeps the same id
and backing storage across bars, so mutations such as `array.push` or
`values.push(...)` persist.
Assigning an array to another variable copies the id, not the backing values;
mutating either name mutates the same runtime-owned array. Passing an array to a
user-defined function also passes the array id, so helpers read the same
backing values through parameters. Pine v4 UDF bodies additionally admit the
exact namespace-call mutation subset `array.set`, `array.pop`,
`array.unshift`, and `array.clear`; all other UDF collection mutation remains
outside the executable subset. Top-level
branches and loops mutate the same array id they can read after control flow
continues. `array.copy` and `values.copy()` allocate a new array id initialized
with the source array's current element values. For label-id, line-id, box-id,
and table-id arrays, copied elements still reference the same drawing objects;
only the array container is independent. Realtime forming-bar rollback clones the confirmed
runtime store before executing a forming update, so array mutations and copies
made during a forming update do not leak into the confirmed store until a
confirmed update is committed.

For local user-defined types, `Type.new(...)` creates a runtime value containing
the supported scalar field values in declaration order. Field reads return the
stored scalar value. Normal declarations allocate a fresh UDT value when
reached on each bar; `var` UDT declarations preserve the last confirmed UDT
value across bars and roll back during realtime forming updates like other
ordinary `var` values, including typed `var` declarations initialized from
`na`, same-UDT constructors, same-UDT ternary expressions, same-UDT switch
expressions, same-UDT `if` expressions, or same-UDT `for` expressions. Local
scalar-field reassignment evaluates the right-hand expression, replaces that
field in the current UDT value, and writes the updated value back to the
receiver symbol, including the receiver's persistent slot when applicable.
Local `for` expressions may construct a local UDT in their final body
expression, return the final iteration's UDT value, and allow the caller to
store that value and read its fields. Local `while` expressions may likewise
construct or alias a local UDT in their final body expression, return the
latest reached UDT value, and allow the caller to store that value and read its
fields. Top-level, block-local, and loop-local typed UDT declarations may also
initialize from same-local-UDT ternary, switch, or `if` expressions and later
reassign to the same local UDT type; top-level, block-local, and loop-local
typed UDT declarations may also initialize or reassign from same-local-UDT
`for` expressions. UDFs may pass a local UDT value through a parameter and
return that same parameter, or return a
block-local, ternary-expression, final-if, final-for, final-for-in, final-while, or switch-expression alias chain
that starts from that parameter, or return a nested passthrough UDF call that
maps back to that parameter through those same alias forms. Pure UDFs may also
construct and return a local UDT, directly,
through nested pure constructor-helper UDF calls, or through same-local-UDT
ternary, switch, `if` expression, final if/else constructor branches, or final
for bodies, from local UDT parameter scalar fields, scalar fields read through
block-local UDT aliases of those parameters, block-local scalar aliases of
those fields, scalar parameters whose types are inferred from the call
arguments, or block-local scalar aliases of those scalar parameters, using
positional or named constructor field arguments.
Positional and named UDF call arguments both preserve the parameter identity.
The caller may then store the returned value and read its fields. UDF-local
UDT variables may mutate scalar fields before returning the updated value.
Mutating UDT fields on globals or parameters inside UDFs, field mutation inside
methods, local UDT value history references, UDT `varip`, nested UDT fields, UDT
arrays, and broader imported UDT values are rejected before runtime execution or
remain outside the executable subset. Imported UDTs are executable for
host-provided exported scalar-tree types constructed as `alias.Type.new(...)`
read through direct scalar fields such as `value.x` or nested fields such as
`wrapped.point.x`, and reassigned from the
same imported UDT identity, including explicit `alias.Type` typed declarations
with same-identity initialization or reassignment, same-imported-identity
ternary, `if`, `switch`, `while`, and `for` expression results, direct or nested UDF
parameter passthrough returns, direct or nested constructor-return UDFs, and
scalar-tree root-field replacement in top-level, branch, `for`-loop, `while`-loop, and
UDF-local statement contexts, plus scalar-tree value history reads and
`array.from` size/get/first/last, set replacement field reads,
push append field reads, unshift prepend field reads, insert insertion field reads, fill replacement field reads, join positional stringification, includes/indexof/lastindexof structural equality search, sort/sort_indices by the default root field or a compile-time int-index/string-name selector resolving to an int/float/string field, pop/remove/shift return field reads, clear size reset,
copy independent field reads, reverse reordered field reads, slice window field
reads, concat appended field reads, and statement/expression/index-value for-in
value-copy field reads, plus `array<lib.Type>`/`lib.Type[]` declarations
initialized from `na` or same-identity imported UDT array values.
For both local and imported scalar-tree UDT arrays, ternary, `if`, `switch`,
`for`, `for...in`, and `while` results preserve the concrete element identity
through HIR lowering. Array/`na` branches are allowed, while branches carrying
different UDT identities fail semantic analysis.
Local pure UDF/local user-method calls preserve same-local scalar-tree UDT array
identity, and imported pure exported UDF/imported user-method calls preserve
same-imported scalar-tree UDT array identity, through direct parameter,
block-alias, copy, new/from, private nested-call, typed-method, and final
control-flow returns. A direct or alias return keeps the source array id;
`array.copy`, `array.new<T>`/`array.new<alias.Type>`, and `array.from` allocate a
new array id. Lowering derives the element layout from the current call
arguments, rewrites imported type positions for the active alias, and keys
expression metadata by import instance. Interleaved calls over field-order
variants A, B, then A, including two aliases of one physical library, therefore
read the correct fields on every result. Tuple-return lowering applies the same
rule independently to each destructured slot, including tuple literals,
direct/block/nested/final-flow UDF or method results, typed-`na` locals, and
different UDT array identities in different slots. Fresh lower symbols receive
the current call's slot identity before later array element field reads.
Tuple-valued ordinary declarations preserve their element types and per-slot
identities through direct and self aliases, ternary, `if`, or `switch` aliases,
fresh local shadowing, and later tuple destructuring. The first declaration
fixes each UDT-array slot identity; same-identity or `na` reassignment keeps the
existing layout, while direct or control-flow reassignment to a different
identity is rejected before HIR emission. Qualified user-defined UDF/method
results and unqualified plain local UDF results support direct `.size()`,
`.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, `.includes(value)`,
`.indexof(value)`, and `.lastindexof(value)` calls when the result is any
currently supported array kind. Bool/int/float results additionally support
terminal `.every()` and `.some()`. Numeric `array<int>` and `array<float>` results
additionally support terminal `.binary_search(value)` and
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`,
terminal `.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus non-mutating `.abs()` and `.standardize()` transformation chains that
return a fresh same-kind array. Concrete int, float, or string results admit
transforming `.sort_indices(order?)`; concrete same-local or same-imported
scalar-tree UDT results admit `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` when a
compile-time zero-based field index or field name resolves to a root
int/float/string field against the exact result identity; omitting the selector
uses field index `0`. Both forms return a fresh fixed int-array continuation. Every scalar
result plus a concrete same-local or same-imported
scalar-tree UDT-array result also admits terminal `.join(separator?)`. The parser
rewrites the unqualified form to the impossible internal prefix `$call_result`
only for a plain lexical callee; qualified user-defined forms retain their
source alias/type prefix.
Direct `.slice(index_from, index_to)` results preserve the concrete array kind
and UDT identity, share the ordinary live parent window, and may continue
through the closed array-result helper set.
Direct `.concat(id2)` validates the same array kind or exact scalar-tree UDT
identity, appends into and returns the receiver array id, and may continue
through that same helper set. Alias and live-slice receivers update shared
parent backing; fresh derived snapshots remain source-independent. Empty,
upstream-`na`, capacity, arity, and UDF-side-effect behavior stays identical to
ordinary `array.concat`.

Built-in `array.*` producers have one separate, closed receiver path. Its exact
admitted producer set is `array.new_float`, `array.new_int`, `array.new_bool`,
`array.new_string`, `array.new_color`, `array.new_line`, `array.new_linefill`,
`array.new_polyline`, `array.new_label`, `array.new_box`, `array.new_table`,
`array.new<chart.point>`, supported `array.new<UDT>`, `array.from`,
`array.copy`, `array.slice`, `array.concat`, `array.abs`,
`array.standardize`, and `array.sort_indices`.
Existing supported `array.new<T>` scalar, drawing-id, `chart.point`, and
same-local/same-imported scalar-tree UDT source templates reach that path
through their canonical constructor or checked UDT-template form. The parser
marks the receiver with `$builtin_array_result`; only `.size()`, `.get(index)`,
`.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, `.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, and
`.lastindexof(value)`, plus bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()` and numeric-only `.binary_search(value)` and
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)` and
`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)` or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)`, scalar/same-identity scalar-tree UDT `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)`, are admitted after it. The lexical prefix
`array` is reserved for built-in producer recognition, so a user or import
qualifier named `array` cannot use this qualified call-result path.
Only `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()`, numeric `.standardize()`, and sortable-scalar or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` return arrays
that may continue through another allowed step. The terminal `.size()`, `.get()`, `.first()`, `.last()`,
`.includes()`, `.every()`, `.some()`, `.indexof()`, `.lastindexof()`, `.binary_search()`, and
`.binary_search_leftmost()`/`.binary_search_rightmost()`/`.min()`/`.max()`/
`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.join(separator?)` results cannot continue
into a user method or any other call-result method,
including a method on a returned scalar UDT element.
`.concat(id2)` is the sole admitted mutating array-returning continuation. It
returns the receiver id after appending a same-kind/same-identity source, so
alias and live-window writes remain visible while fresh snapshots remain
independent; it stays rejected inside UDF bodies.
The terminal `.clear()` and `.reverse()` mutations likewise cannot continue:
both return `void`, accept no explicit arguments, and are allowed only outside
UDF bodies.
Terminal `.pop()` also accepts no explicit arguments and is UDF-rejected, but
returns the removed receiver-typed final element (or `na`) before terminating.
Terminal `.shift()` has the same return typing and gates while removing the
first element and retaining the relative order of the remaining elements.
Terminal `.remove(index)` accepts one simple-int-compatible index and returns
the selected removed element. Explicit `na` indexes return `na` without
mutation, negative indexes and out-of-range errors retain ordinary semantics,
and the result cannot continue.
Terminal `.push(value)` accepts one element-compatible value, appends it to the
resolved array result, returns `void`, and cannot continue. Value-kind/UDT-
identity checks, upstream-`na` no-op behavior, UDF rejection, and the 100000-
element limit are unchanged.
Terminal `.unshift(value)` accepts the same compatible value set, prepends at
the resolved result's start, returns `void`, and cannot continue. It retains
the same UDT-identity, upstream-`na` value-evaluation/no-op, UDF-rejection, and
100000-element boundaries.
Terminal `.insert(index, value)` additionally requires a simple-int-compatible
index, preserves positive, in-range negative, end, explicit-`na`, and bounds-
error behavior, returns `void`, and cannot continue. Value/identity, upstream-
`na`, UDF-rejection, and parent-array capacity behavior remain unchanged.
Terminal `.set(index, value)` shares the index/value contract but replaces one
existing positive or in-range negative slot without changing length. It returns
`void` and cannot continue; explicit `na` indexes and upstream-`na` receivers
no-op after value evaluation, while empty/out-of-range and UDF behavior remains
unchanged.
Terminal `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)` validates an element-compatible
value and optional simple-int-compatible half-open bounds. Omitted bounds fill
the full result; live slices write through to parent backing, while fresh map/
matrix-derived arrays mutate only their snapshots. It returns `void` and cannot
continue. Explicit `na`, negative, reversed, oversized, empty, and upstream-`na`
cases no-op after all supplied arguments are evaluated; UDF mutation remains
rejected.
Terminal `.sort(order?, sort_field?)` mutates concrete int/float/string results
using the ordinary ascending default and const-order rules. Same-local or same-
imported scalar-tree UDT results use root field index `0` by default and accept
a compile-time zero-based integer field index or string field name selecting a
root int/float/string field. Lowering canonicalizes that selector to the field
index for the exact element identity. A top-level `na` UDT element raises a
runtime error before sorting; `na` inside the selected field remains sortable
with the ordinary special-value placement. Alias/live-slice results reorder
backing parents; fresh map/matrix-derived arrays reorder only their snapshots.
The call returns `void`, cannot
continue, treats empty/upstream-`na` results as no-ops after order evaluation,
and retains unsupported-kind, order/field/arity, and UDF-side-effect gates.

Analysis then fails closed unless the producer arguments resolve to the exact
supported array kind and, for UDT arrays, one concrete same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree identity. `get` preserves that element identity and
the existing named/`na`/negative-index and bounds behavior; `size` and `last`
retain the existing empty and typed-`na` semantics. The postfix receiver is
lowered as an array helper rather than as a same-named local method or imported
function, and `copy` allocates independently from the source array. An
unqualified local UDF result carrying a concrete local or imported scalar UDT
identity may instead invoke an existing pure user method.

The allowed postfix helper does not change the producer's own semantics.
`array.slice(...)` returns a live shallow window into its parent, so direct
postfix reads observe that window; `array.slice(...).copy()` snapshots its
current values into an independent array. `array.concat(left, right)` appends
to `left` in place and returns the first array id. A following postfix read is
itself non-mutating, but the concat call is still a collection side effect and
remains rejected inside UDFs. Mixed scalar-return identities, non-scalar
UDT-array returns, unsupported or unknown templates, non-array/non-UDT results,
unknown/`na` results without a concrete supported type or identity, other
`array.*` producer/member calls, built-in namespaces and templates outside the
exact cross-namespace producer set below,
postfix helpers outside the forty-four-item read/copy/search/transform/aggregate/mutation set, and postfix
mutation other than `.concat(id2)`/`.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)` remain unsupported boundaries.
The first/last index readers reuse ordinary element-kind, concrete UDT-identity, and
structural/object equality rules. `.indexof(value)` returns the first
zero-based match and `.lastindexof(value)` returns the last, both as
`simple int`; each returns `-1` for missing values, empty concrete arrays, and
upstream `na` arrays, performs no mutation, and is terminal.
Bool/int/float-only `.every()` returns fixed `series bool`, with nonzero
numerics and `true` treated as truthy and zero, `false`, or element `na`
treated as false. Empty arrays return true, upstream `na` arrays propagate,
the source is not mutated, and the scalar result is terminal. String, color,
drawing/object, chart-point, and UDT results plus extra arguments remain
rejected.
Bool/int/float-only `.some()` shares the same truthiness and fixed `series bool`
contract, but succeeds when any nonzero numeric or `true` element exists.
Zero, `false`, and element `na` do not satisfy it; empty arrays return false,
upstream `na` arrays propagate, the source remains unchanged, and the result is
terminal. The same unsupported receiver kinds and extra-arity boundary apply.
Numeric-only `.binary_search(value)` retains the ordinary numeric-array
receiver and numeric-value checks. The caller supplies ascending contents; the
runtime performs an exact lower-bound search, so duplicate matches return the
leftmost index. It returns `simple int`, uses `-1` for missing, empty, and
upstream-`na` arrays, performs no mutation, and is terminal. Bool, string,
color, drawing/object, chart-point, and UDT array results remain rejected.
Numeric-only `.binary_search_leftmost(value)` shares those checks and the
ascending-input contract. An exact duplicate returns its first index; a miss
returns the nearest element on the left, clamped to index `0` below the minimum
and the last index above the maximum. Empty and upstream-`na` arrays return
`-1`. The fixed result is `simple int`, non-mutating, and terminal.
Numeric-only `.binary_search_rightmost(value)` is the symmetric ceiling search.
An exact duplicate returns its last index; a miss returns the nearest element
on the right, clamped to index `0` below the minimum and the last index above the
maximum. It shares the numeric/ascending, empty/upstream-`na`, `simple int`,
non-mutation, and terminal boundaries.

Numeric-only `.abs()` reuses the ordinary numeric-array check and allocates a
fresh array with the receiver's int or float element kind. It preserves `na`
elements, leaves the source array unchanged, returns an empty array for an
empty receiver, and propagates an upstream `na` array. Because the result is a
concrete array, it may continue through `.copy()`, another `.abs()`, or any
currently admitted terminal reader. Bool, string, color, drawing/object,
chart-point, and UDT array results remain rejected.

Numeric-only `.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)` return the same `series int` or `series
float` kind as the receiver element type. After filtering `na` elements, `nth`
is a zero-based ascending rank for `min` and descending rank for `max`, and
defaults to `0`; duplicate values retain separate ranks. Dynamic integer ranks
are accepted. Empty, all-`na`, and
upstream-`na` arrays, plus `na`, negative, or out-of-range ranks, return `na`.
The helper does not mutate its receiver and its scalar result is terminal.

Numeric-only `.sum()` returns the receiver element type's `series int` or
`series float`, ignores `na` elements, and returns `na` for empty, all-`na`, or
upstream-`na` arrays. It does not mutate its receiver and is terminal.

Numeric-only `.avg()` averages the same filtered values but always returns
`series float`. It shares the empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, non-mutation, and
terminal boundaries, and converts a non-finite result to `na`.

Numeric-only `.range()` returns the receiver element type's `series int` or
`series float` and computes maximum minus minimum over filtered non-`na`
values. Empty, all-`na`, and upstream-`na` arrays return `na`, as does a non-
finite float difference; the result is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.median()` sorts filtered non-`na` values, selects the middle
item for an odd count, and averages the middle pair for an even count. It
returns the receiver's `series int` or `series float`; integer pair means
truncate toward zero. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, and non-finite float
medians return `na`; the result is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.mode()` sorts filtered non-`na` values and returns the most
frequent value as the receiver's `series int` or `series float`. Equal maximum
frequencies select the smaller value. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, and
all-unique arrays return `na`; the result is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)` sorts filtered non-`na`
values and selects `ceil(percentage / 100 * count) - 1`, with `0` clamped to
the minimum and `100` selecting the maximum. The positional or named percentage
may be series/simple numeric. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, runtime typed-
`na`, negative, and above-100 percentages return `na`; the receiver-derived
`series int`/`series float` result is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)` sorts the same
filtered values and interpolates between the floor/ceiling members at
`percentage / 100 * (count - 1)`. Integer and float receivers, including a
single remaining element, return `series float`. Positional or named series/
simple numeric percentages are accepted. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`,
runtime typed-`na`, out-of-range, and non-finite interpolation results return
`na`; the read is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.percentrank(index)` keeps the original array order for target
selection, then filters `na` values from the comparison population and returns
`count(value <= target) / non_na_count * 100` as `series float`. Duplicate
values count independently. The positional or named index must be simple int-
compatible. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, target-`na`, runtime typed-`na`,
negative, and out-of-range indexes return `na`; the read is non-mutating and
terminal.

Numeric-only `.covariance(id2, biased?)` requires a same-length runtime numeric
second array, pairs cells by original index, and discards a pair when either
side is `na`. It returns `series float`, using the biased population denominator
by default and the sample denominator when `biased` is `false` or `na`. The
second array and bias may be positional or named. Empty/all-`na`/upstream-`na`
pairs, mismatched lengths, sample populations below two pairs, and non-finite
results return `na`; the read is non-mutating and terminal.

Numeric-only `.standardize()` allocates a fresh fixed `simple array<float>` and
leaves the source unchanged. It computes the mean and population standard
deviation from non-`na` values, preserving `na` positions when at least one
numeric value exists. A zero or non-finite standard deviation makes every
numeric output position `na`, so constant input produces a same-length all-
`na` array. Empty and all-`na` sources produce an empty array, while an
upstream-`na` source produces `na`. The new array can continue through the
closed reader, `.copy()`, `.abs()`, `.standardize()`, and `.sort_indices()` set.

Numeric-only `.variance(biased?)` returns fixed `series float`, filters `na`
elements, and leaves the source unchanged. Omitted or `true` bias uses the
population denominator; positional or named `false` or `na` bias uses the
sample denominator. A single numeric value has population variance `0`, while
an unbiased population below two values returns `na`. Empty, all-`na`,
upstream-`na`, insufficient-sample, and non-finite results also return `na`.
The scalar read is terminal.

Numeric-only `.stdev(biased?)` shares `.variance()`'s concrete receiver,
filtered-`na`, population versus sample bias, positional/named argument,
empty/all-`na`/upstream-`na`, sample-size, non-finite, non-mutation, and
terminal boundaries. Its fixed `series float` result is the square root of the
selected variance; one numeric value therefore returns population standard
deviation `0` and unbiased `na`.

Int, float, or string `.sort_indices(order?)` allocates a fresh fixed
`simple array<int>` of stable original indexes without mutating its call-result
receiver. Omitted order is ascending; explicit `order.descending` uses the
existing reverse value ordering while retaining equal-value source order.
Established float-`na` and string-empty placement, empty results, and upstream-
`na` propagation are unchanged. The new int array retains the closed
array-result prefix, so nested sort, copy, read, search, transformation, and
numeric-statistic chains remain available. Bool/color/object/chart-point
receivers, invalid order/arity, direct mutation, and UDT call-result ordering
without an identity-preserving binding remain fail closed.

Terminal top-level `.clear()` reuses the ordinary array mutation runtime. An
alias-returning `array.concat` or local/imported UDF/method producer therefore
clears the shared backing id, and clearing a nested `array.slice` deletes the
live window from its parent. Matrix row/column/eigenvalue, map key/value, and
array-returning `matrix.mult` producers allocate fresh snapshots, so clearing
their result does not mutate the source matrix or map. Empty and upstream-`na`
results are no-ops. The call returns `void`, cannot continue, and semantic
analysis rejects it inside UDF bodies as a collection side effect.
Terminal top-level `.reverse()` follows the same alias, live-window, fresh-
snapshot, empty/upstream-`na`, `void`, no-continuation, and UDF-side-effect
boundaries, but reverses the current array values instead of removing them.
Terminal top-level `.pop()` follows the same alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot
and UDF boundaries, removes the final value, and returns it with the resolved
element kind and UDT identity. Empty and upstream-`na` results return `na`.
Terminal top-level `.shift()` follows those boundaries, removes and returns the
first resolved value, and preserves the order of the remaining values.
Terminal top-level `.remove(index)` follows those identity and storage
boundaries for the selected positive or in-range negative index. An explicit
`na` index or upstream-`na` receiver returns `na` without mutation; out-of-range
indexes retain the ordinary runtime error.
Terminal top-level `.push(value)` follows the same alias/live-window/fresh-
snapshot and UDF boundaries, appends at the resolved result's end, and returns
`void`. Scalar/UDT value compatibility and capacity errors retain ordinary
array semantics.
Terminal top-level `.unshift(value)` follows those same boundaries, prepends at
the resolved result's start, and returns `void`; a live slice inserts at its
parent-window start while a fresh derived snapshot leaves its source unchanged.
Terminal top-level `.insert(index, value)` follows those boundaries at the
resolved positive, in-range negative, or end index. A live slice inserts in its
parent window, fresh derived snapshots leave sources unchanged, and explicit
`na` indexes or upstream-`na` receivers no-op after value evaluation.
Terminal top-level `.set(index, value)` follows the same identity and storage
boundaries but replaces one existing slot without changing length. Live slices
write their parent slot, fresh derived snapshots leave sources unchanged, and
explicit `na` indexes or upstream-`na` receivers no-op after value evaluation.
Terminal top-level `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)` follows the same
identity/storage boundary for a full result or valid half-open range. Live
slices fill their parent window, fresh derived snapshots leave sources
unchanged, and invalid or explicit-`na` bounds plus upstream-`na` receivers
no-op after evaluating the value and every supplied bound.
Terminal top-level `.sort(order?, sort_field?)` reorders the same alias/live-
slice backing for int/float/string results or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT
results with a sortable root field selected by default index `0` or a
compile-time integer index/string name. Fresh map/matrix-derived
arrays remain source-independent, and empty/upstream-`na` results no-op after
the optional order is evaluated.

The same `$builtin_array_result` lowering now has one additional exact set of
seven fixed cross-namespace producers: `str.split`, `ta.pivot_point_levels`,
`matrix.row`, `matrix.col`, `matrix.eigenvalues`, `map.keys`, and `map.values`.
Each admits only `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, `.lastindexof(value)`, bool/int/float-only
`.every()`/`.some()`, and numeric-only
`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/
`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)`, all-scalar terminal `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`; only `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()`, numeric `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string `.sort_indices(order?)` can continue with another allowed array chain. The other
twenty-nine terminal value results and the eight `void` mutations cannot continue. `str.split` and
`ta.pivot_point_levels` retain their
existing `array<string>` and `array<float>` results. `matrix.row` and
`matrix.col` return independent element-array snapshots for runtime-owned
float, int, bool, string, and color matrices, while `matrix.eigenvalues`
retains its independent `array<float>` result for the supported numeric-matrix
subset. `map.keys` and `map.values` return independent insertion-order arrays
whose element kind matches the scalar key or value template, where each map
template side is one of int, float, bool, string, or color. A postfix helper
does not change empty/`na`, negative-index, bounds-error, element-kind, or
snapshot-copy behavior.

Namespace-qualified `matrix.mult(...)` uses a separate, closed
`$builtin_matrix_result` candidate path whose helper family is selected from
the resolved `MatrixMult` result type. Matrix-by-array, array-by-matrix, and
array-by-array overloads resolve to `array<float>` and may use `.size()`,
`.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, `.includes(value)`,
`.indexof(value)`, `.lastindexof(value)`, `.every()`, `.some()`, `.binary_search(value)`, and
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.sort_indices(order?)`/`.join(separator?)`.
Matrix-by-matrix,
matrix-by-scalar, and scalar-by-matrix overloads resolve to `matrix<float>` and
may use `.rows()`, `.columns()`, `.elements_count()`, `.get(row, column)`, and
`.copy()`, plus `.row(index)`, `.col(index)`, and numeric-only
`.eigenvalues()`, `.is_zero()`, `.is_binary()`, `.is_diagonal()`,
`.is_identity()`, `.is_symmetric()`, `.is_antisymmetric()`, and
`.is_stochastic()`, plus numeric-only terminal
`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.min()`/`.max()`/`.mode()`/`.trace()`/`.det()`/`.rank()` and
all-kind terminal `.is_square()`. Int inputs still produce float collections.
Matrix `.copy()` may continue with another admitted matrix helper;
`.row(index)` and `.col(index)` return fresh element-kind-preserving arrays;
`.eigenvalues()` retains the existing numeric check and returns a fresh
`array<float>`. These three helpers
switch to the closed `.size()`/`.get()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/`.concat(id2)`/
`.includes(value)`/`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`/
`.every()`/`.some()`/`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)` array-result path,
plus `.binary_search_rightmost(value)`, `.abs()`, and
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.sort_indices(order?)`/`.join(separator?)`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`, where array
`.copy()`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string
`.sort_indices(order?)` continue and the other twenty-nine terminal value results
are terminal.
`.is_square()`
instead
returns the ordinary simple bool for every supported matrix element kind and
is terminal, so no parser result-prefix transition occurs. Numeric-only
`.is_zero()` likewise returns the ordinary simple bool using the existing
exact-zero, empty, and `na`-cell rules and is terminal without a prefix
transition. Numeric-only `.is_binary()` does the same with the strict 0-or-1,
empty, and `na`-cell rules. Numeric-only `.is_diagonal()` permits rectangular
shape and arbitrary main-diagonal cells but requires exact-zero off-diagonal
cells; it is terminal as well. Numeric-only `.is_identity()` adds square shape
plus exact-one diagonal and exact-zero off-diagonal requirements, rejects every
`na` cell, and remains terminal. Numeric-only `.is_symmetric()` requires square
shape and exact transposed-pair equality, rejects every `na` cell, and is
terminal. Numeric-only `.is_antisymmetric()` requires square shape, an exact-
zero main diagonal, and exact negation across transposed pairs, rejects every
`na` cell, and is terminal. Numeric-only `.is_stochastic()` requires a non-
empty matrix of finite non-negative values and accepts either exact unit row
sums or exact unit column sums; it is terminal. Numeric-only `.sum()` returns a
fixed `series float`, ignores `na` cells, returns `na` when no numeric cell is
present or the sum is non-finite, propagates upstream `na`, and is terminal.
Numeric-only `.avg()` likewise returns a fixed `series float`, but divides by
the count of non-`na` numeric cells; no numeric cells or a non-finite result
yield `na`, upstream `na` propagates, and the reader is terminal.
Numeric-only `.min()` also returns a fixed `series float`, scans only non-`na`
numeric cells, returns `na` when none exist or the selected minimum is non-
finite, propagates upstream `na`, and is terminal.
Numeric-only `.max()` mirrors `.min()` with the selected maximum and otherwise
retains the same fixed `series float`, `na`, non-finite, upstream-`na`, and
terminal rules.
Numeric-only `.mode()` returns a fixed `series float`, ignores `na` cells,
selects the smallest value among equally frequent repeats, and returns `na`
for empty, all-`na`, no-repeat, selected non-finite, or upstream-`na` results;
it is terminal.
Numeric-only `.trace()` returns a fixed `series float`, sums non-`na` main-
diagonal cells over `min(rows, columns)`, and returns `na` for an empty/all-
`na` diagonal, non-finite sum, or upstream-`na` result; it is terminal.
Numeric-only `.det()` returns a fixed `series float`, retains the runtime
square-matrix error, returns `1.0` for `0 x 0`, zero for singular matrices, and
`na` for invalid cells, non-finite results, or upstream `na`; it is terminal
and adds no static shape inference.
Numeric-only `.rank()` returns a fixed `series int`, supports rectangular and
singular matrices, returns `0` for zero-element matrices, and returns `na` for
invalid/non-finite cells or upstream `na`; it is terminal.
Matrix-valued `.transpose()` accepts every supported matrix element kind,
allocates an independent matrix with swapped row/column counts, propagates
upstream `na`, and retains the matrix-result prefix for `.copy()`, repeated
`.transpose()`, or any supported matrix reader.
Matrix-valued `.submatrix(...)` accepts the same element kinds, allocates an
independent optional/default half-open range, preserves empty row/column
shapes, propagates upstream `na`, and retains that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.inv()` always allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, preserves square shape for invertible inputs, returns empty
`0 x 0` for empty input, yields `na` for singular, invalid-cell, non-finite, or
upstream-`na` inputs, and retains that prefix. Non-square inputs keep the
ordinary runtime error because static matrix shapes are not inferred.
Numeric matrix-valued `.pinv()` also allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, swaps rectangular row/column counts, preserves singular
matrix-valued results and swapped zero-cell shapes, yields `na` for invalid-
cell, non-finite, or upstream-`na` inputs, and retains that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.eigenvectors()` allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, preserves square shape for a complete real eigenvector basis,
returns empty `0 x 0`, keeps the runtime non-square error, yields `na` for
invalid-cell, non-finite, non-real, incomplete, or upstream-`na` results, and
retains that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.pow(power)` allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, retains the simple-int argument gate and runtime square-matrix
boundary, supports identity/copy/positive powers and empty `0 x 0`, preserves
`na` cells for positive powers, keeps negative and `na` power errors, and
retains that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.kron(other)` allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>` after the numeric-matrix operand check, multiplies both source
row and column dimensions, preserves `na` cells and zero dimensions, propagates
upstream `na`, retains the matrix cell-budget error, and keeps that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.diff(other)` allocates an independent fixed
`matrix<float>` after the numeric-matrix-or-scalar operand check, preserves the
receiver shape and left-to-right subtraction, propagates `na` cells, `na`
scalars, and upstream `na`, preserves zero dimensions, retains the matching-
shape runtime error for matrix operands, and keeps that prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.mult(other)` preserves all three existing method
overloads after the numeric matrix/scalar/array operand check. Matrix operands
allocate an independent `matrix<float>` with receiver rows and operand columns;
scalar operands allocate an independent receiver-shaped `matrix<float>`; and
numeric-array operands allocate an independent `array<float>` with one value
per receiver row. The resolved runtime result selects matrix-helper or array-
helper continuation. Cell and scalar `na`, upstream `na`, zero inner
dimensions, multiplication order, matrix cell-budget checks, matrix dimension
checks, and array-length checks retain their existing behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.set(row, column, value)`. Alias-returning local UDF and local user-method
results update shared matrix storage. Namespace, bound-transform, imported
function, and imported-method producers return fresh matrices, so the write is
confined to that transient result and source matrices remain unchanged. The
operation preserves the existing simple-int index checks, element-kind value
validation, bounds errors, upstream-`na` value evaluation/no-op behavior,
`void` result, no-continuation rule, and UDF side-effect rejection.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal `.fill(value)`
with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It validates the concrete
float/int/bool/string/color element kind, replaces every cell in place,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. Empty and upstream-`na` results, value
evaluation, invalid type/arity, and UDF side-effect rejection retain ordinary
`matrix.fill` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal `.reverse()`
with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It reverses the row-major cell
sequence in place without changing shape, returns `void`, and cannot continue.
Empty and upstream-`na` results, invalid arity, and UDF side-effect rejection
retain ordinary `matrix.reverse` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.reshape(rows, columns)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
preserves row-major cells, requires simple-int non-negative dimensions whose
product matches the current element count, returns `void`, and cannot
continue. Upstream-`na` receivers still evaluate both dimensions before
no-oping; negative/`na` dimensions, count mismatch, invalid arity/type, and UDF
side-effect rejection retain ordinary `matrix.reshape` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.swap_rows(row1, row2)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
requires two simple-int row indexes, swaps complete rows without changing
shape or concrete element kind, returns `void`, and cannot continue. Equal
indexes are a no-op. Bounds/`na` index errors, upstream-`na` argument
evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect rejection retain ordinary
`matrix.swap_rows` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.swap_columns(column1, column2)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage
split. It requires two simple-int column indexes, swaps complete columns
without changing shape or concrete element kind, returns `void`, and cannot
continue. Equal indexes are a no-op. Bounds/`na` index errors, upstream-`na`
argument evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect rejection retain
ordinary `matrix.swap_columns` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.remove_row(row)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It requires
one simple-int row index, removes the selected complete row, including from a
zero-column matrix, while preserving column count and concrete element kind,
returns `void`, and cannot continue.
Bounds/`na` index errors, upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid arity/type,
and UDF side-effect rejection retain ordinary `matrix.remove_row` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.remove_col(column)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
requires one simple-int column index, removes the selected complete column,
including from a zero-row matrix, while preserving row count and concrete
element kind, returns `void`, and cannot continue. Bounds/`na` index errors,
upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
rejection retain ordinary `matrix.remove_col` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.add_row(row, array_id)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
requires one simple-int insertion index and an element-kind-matched array,
copies the array into a complete new row—including for a zero-column matrix—
while preserving column count and concrete element kind, returns `void`, and
cannot continue. The insertion index admits `0..=rows`. Bounds/`na` index,
array-size, cell-budget, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
boundaries retain ordinary `matrix.add_row` behavior.
Every concrete matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.add_col(column, array_id)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
requires one simple-int insertion index and an element-kind-matched array,
copies the array into a complete new column—including for a zero-row matrix—
while preserving row count and concrete element kind, returns `void`, and
cannot continue. The insertion index admits `0..=columns`. Bounds/`na` index,
array-size, cell-budget, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
boundaries retain ordinary `matrix.add_col` behavior.
Every concrete numeric matrix-valued call result also supports terminal
`.sort(column?, order?)` with the same alias-versus-fresh storage split. It
defaults to column 0 and ascending order, reorders complete rows without
changing shape or element kind, keeps equal-key rows stable, and places `na`
last ascending and first descending. It returns `void` and cannot continue.
Column bounds/`na`, unsupported-order, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, non-
numeric receiver, and UDF side-effect boundaries retain ordinary
`matrix.sort` behavior.
Other terminal readers, wrong-result helpers, invalid arity or argument types,
broader helpers, and mutation other than `.set(...)`/`.fill(...)`/`.reverse()`/`.reshape(...)`/`.add_row(...)`/`.add_col(...)`/`.sort(...)`/`.swap_rows(...)`/`.swap_columns(...)`/`.remove_row(...)`/`.remove_col(...)` fail closed. The existing bound-receiver
`matrix_id.mult(array).size()` path remains on array-helper dispatch. Exact
bound numeric-matrix-receiver matrix-valued `matrix_id.mult(other)` results now
share the forty-four matrix helpers and the copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose/row/column/eigenvalue/
predicate/aggregate-reader continuation rules for matrix or
scalar operands while preserving the existing overload, shape, `na`, empty
inner dimension, and cell-budget boundaries. Unqualified local-UDF results that infer
a concrete supported matrix kind now share the forty-four matrix helpers through
`$call_result`. Parameter passthrough, block aliases, nested calls, same-kind
control flow, constructed and matrix-operation returns, named/reordered
arguments, and zero dimensions keep their normal call-specific float/int/bool/
string/color kind and storage behavior. Local and imported user-method results
with a concrete supported matrix kind share the same helpers through receiver-
style, local-type-qualified or alias-qualified, direct-constructor-receiver,
block/nested/control-flow, five-kind, zero-dimension, dual-alias, independent-
copy, and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-continuation paths. Registered imported pure-function
results with a concrete supported matrix kind share those helpers across alias-
qualified, block/nested/control-flow, five-kind, zero-dimension, dual-alias,
independent-copy, and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-continuation paths. Unknown/`na`, scalar, array,
map, unregistered or unresolved user-function matrix results, broader-helper,
mutation other than terminal `.set(...)`/`.fill(...)`/`.reverse()`/`.reshape(...)`/`.add_row(...)`/`.add_col(...)`/`.sort(...)`/`.swap_rows(...)`/`.swap_columns(...)`/`.remove_row(...)`/`.remove_col(...)`, and terminal-read continuation cases
remain fail closed. The row/
column-array transition applies uniformly to every concrete matrix producer described
below; producer-specific “copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-only” wording refers only to continuing as a
matrix result, while `.row(index)`, `.col(index)`, or numeric `.eigenvalues()`
continues as an array result and `.is_square()` plus numeric `.is_zero()` are
terminal, as are numeric `.is_binary()`, `.is_diagonal()`, `.is_identity()`,
`.is_symmetric()`, `.is_antisymmetric()`, `.is_stochastic()`, and `.sum()`.
`.avg()` is terminal under the same aggregate continuation rule.
`.min()` is terminal under that rule as well.
`.max()` is terminal under that rule as well.
`.mode()` is terminal under that rule as well.
`.trace()` is terminal under that rule as well.
`.det()` is terminal under that rule as well.
`.rank()` is terminal under that rule as well.
Exact namespace
`matrix.copy(values)`
also enters this
prefix, always resolves through the matrix helper family, and preserves the
source float/int/bool/string/color matrix kind through `SameAsArg`; its returned
store and every postfix copy are independent. Exact bound matrix-receiver
`values.copy()` results now share the same seven all-kind helpers, add
`.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results, preserve shape
and element kind, and keep source/nested-copy storage independent; non-matrix
receivers fail the existing method type check. Exact namespace
`matrix.transpose(values)` shares that seven-helper and
element-kind contract, swaps row/column shape, and
returns independent storage. Exact bound matrix-receiver `values.transpose()`
results now share those direct helpers, add `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`,
`.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results, and
retain copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation while other
matrix-valued helpers and mutation remain gated. Exact namespace
`matrix.submatrix(values, ...)` also shares the
seven-helper and element-kind contract, returning an independent half-open range
with default full bounds and empty row/column slices. Exact bound matrix-receiver
`values.submatrix(...)` results now share those helpers, add `.diff(other)`,
`.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for
numeric results, and retain
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation after the original receiver type check. Exact namespace
`matrix.kron(left, right)` returns a fixed `matrix<float>` for numeric matrix
operands, expands both source dimensions, preserves independent storage, `na`,
and zero-dimension behavior, and shares the same fourteen helpers. Exact bound
numeric-matrix-receiver `values.kron(other)` results now share those helpers
and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation while preserving the existing numeric input checks.
Exact namespace
`matrix.diff(left, right)` returns fixed `matrix<float>` results for
matrix-matrix, matrix-scalar, and scalar-matrix numeric operands, preserving
the selected matrix shape, left-to-right operand order, independent storage,
`na`, and zero-dimension behavior. Exact bound numeric-matrix-receiver
`values.diff(other)` results now share the fourteen direct helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation while preserving the existing operand checks and direction. Exact
namespace `matrix.pow(values, power)` returns a fixed
square `matrix<float>` for numeric matrices and simple-int powers, preserving
independent identity/copy/positive-power results plus `na` and empty `0 x 0`
behavior. Exact bound numeric-square-matrix-receiver `values.pow(power)`
results now share the fourteen direct helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation while
preserving the existing receiver and power checks. Exact
namespace `matrix.inv(values)` returns an independent square
`matrix<float>` for invertible numeric inputs, an empty `0 x 0` matrix for
empty input, and `na` for singular or invalid-cell inputs. Exact bound
numeric-square-matrix-receiver `values.inv()` results now share the fourteen direct
helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation while preserving the existing receiver,
shape, singular, and invalid-cell boundaries. Exact namespace
`matrix.pinv(values)`
returns an independent fixed `matrix<float>` pseudo-inverse for numeric inputs,
swaps row and column counts for rectangular matrices, preserves singular
matrix-valued results, returns the corresponding zero-cell swapped shape for
zero-row or zero-column inputs, and yields `na` for invalid-cell inputs. Exact
bound numeric-matrix-receiver `values.pinv()` results now share the fourteen direct
helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation while preserving the existing receiver,
shape, singular, zero-cell, and invalid-cell boundaries. Exact namespace
`matrix.eigenvectors(values)` returns an independent fixed `matrix<float>`
whose columns are real eigenvectors for numeric square inputs, returns empty
`0 x 0` for empty input, and yields `na` for invalid-cell, non-real, or
incomplete results. Exact bound numeric-square-matrix-receiver
`values.eigenvectors()` results now share the fourteen direct helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation while preserving the existing receiver, shape, empty,
invalid-cell, non-real, and incomplete-result boundaries. Exact `matrix.new<float>`,
`matrix.new<int>`, `matrix.new<bool>`,
`matrix.new<string>`, and `matrix.new<color>` template results also enter this
path, preserve their element kind, requested shape, type-compatible initial or
default `na` cells, fresh allocation, and copy independence. All five kinds
expose the same seven helpers, while numeric template results additionally
expose `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)`. Exact supported scalar `map.new<K,V>` templates use the
separate `$builtin_map_result` path, preserve known key/value kinds, allocate a
fresh empty map, and expose `.size()`, terminal `.put(key, value)`, `.clear()`,
`.remove(key)`, and `.put_all(source)`, `.get(key)`,
`.contains(key)`, `.copy()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`. Only `.copy()` may
continue another map helper; `.put(...)`, `.clear()`, `.remove(...)`, and `.put_all(...)` return
`void` and cannot continue;
`.keys()` and `.values()` return fresh key/value-kind-preserving arrays that
admit direct binding and the closed array read/search set plus `.slice(index_from, index_to)` and bool/int/float
`.every()`/`.some()`, all-scalar terminal `.join(separator?)`, and numeric `.abs()`
and terminal `.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus transforming `.standardize()`, `.sort_indices(order?)`, and `.concat(id2)` with copy/slice/concat/abs/standardize/sort_indices array continuation. Other map mutation and
unsupported map templates remain gated. Exact namespace
`map.copy(existing)` results enter the same path, retain the source key/value
kinds and entries in independent backing storage, and expose the same helpers
with copy-only continuation; non-map inputs remain errors. Unqualified
local-UDF results with one concrete supported scalar map template share the
ten helpers through `$call_result`, preserving call-specific template/content
metadata, empty maps, named/reordered arguments, and independent copies; only
copy may continue. Imported pure-function results with one concrete supported
scalar map template share those helpers through the registered-function path
for alias-qualified, block-return, nested-function, same-template control-flow,
constructed-result, scalar-template-interleaving, same-library dual-alias, and
independent-copy cases. Local and imported user-method results retain their
analysis-marked receiver-style and qualified/direct-constructor cases.
Terminal `.put(...)` validates the concrete key/value kinds, preserves key
position on replacement and appends new keys, mutates local alias-returning
UDF/method results, and remains isolated on fresh built-in/imported producers.
Terminal `.clear()` empties the same backing entry list and uses the same local-
alias mutation versus fresh built-in/imported isolation split.
Terminal `.remove(key)` validates the concrete key kind, deletes a matching
entry without reordering retained keys, no-ops for a missing key, and uses that
same alias-versus-fresh split.
Terminal `.put_all(source)` requires identical key/value templates, clones the
source entries before merging for safe self-merge, replaces retained-key values
in place, appends new keys in source order, and uses the same storage split.
Unknown/`na`, scalar, array, matrix, wrong-template/key/value, broader-helper,
map mutation outside terminal `.put(...)`/`.clear()`/`.remove(...)`/`.put_all(...)`, call-result-array mutation other
than `.concat(id2)`, and continuation after a terminal key/value-array reader
remain fail closed; direct UDF mutation is still rejected. Every other
matrix-returning call,
unsupported `matrix.new` template, and other namespace/non-producer call
remains outside this path. Built-in namespace prefixes remain reserved, so
same-named user or import qualifiers do not enter it. The extension carries no
UDT/import identity and changes no public output schema.

Both caller-side `for...in` over returned arrays and in-callee `for...in` over
generic same-local scalar-tree UDT-array parameters preserve concrete identity,
including final expression results that return the loop element itself or use
it to rebuild a same-identity UDT array.
Scalar-field imported UDT `varip` declarations may persist the same imported
identity by value across forming updates.
Local/imported structural lookalikes are distinct assignment identities;
imported UDT collections beyond the fixture-backed same-scalar-tree call-return
subset above, scalar-tree `array.from`, and `array<lib.Type>`/`lib.Type[]`
size/get/first/last, set-replacement, push-append,
unshift-prepend, insert-insertion, fill-replacement, join-stringification,
search-structural-equality, sort-by-field, pop/remove/shift return, clear-size,
copy-read, reverse-read, slice-window, concat-append, and for-in-value-copy
subset,
nested field mutation, direct private imported UDT access and imported UDT value history outside the scalar-tree metadata subset, UDF
parameter/global field side effects, and method
receiver/parameter/global field side effects remain unsupported.

Pure local UDT methods execute as receiver functions. The receiver value is
passed as the first internal argument and the method body is evaluated through
the same lowered expression path as a local UDF body. A pure method may accept
additional local UDT parameters and return the receiver itself, a block-local
alias chain that starts from the receiver or another local UDT parameter,
ternary-expression aliases, final if/else, final for, final while, or
switch-expression local UDT aliases of those values, another local UDT
parameter directly or through a nested method passthrough call, or construct
and return a local UDT directly, through nested pure constructor-helper UDF
calls, or through same-local-UDT ternary, switch, `if` expression, final
if/else constructor branches, or final for bodies. Supported method
constructors may read receiver or local UDT parameter scalar fields, scalar
fields through block-local receiver or local UDT parameter aliases, block-local
scalar aliases of those fields, inferred scalar parameters, or block-local
scalar aliases of those parameters, using positional or named constructor field
arguments; the caller may store that returned UDT value and read its fields.
Receiver-style and alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT methods may also return
the receiver or a same-identity UDT parameter directly, through block-local,
ternary-expression, final-if, final-for, final-while, or switch-expression
aliases, and preserve that imported identity for caller-side field reads, or
directly, through a nested method call, or through a ternary expression
construct and return the same imported UDT identity for caller-side field reads.
For local methods, a typed same-local scalar-tree UDT array parameter may be
returned directly or through block aliases, copies, fresh constructors, nested
local calls, and final control flow with call-specific identity. Qualified
user-defined results returning any supported array kind, unqualified plain
local UDF results, the exact built-in `array.*` producer allowlist, and the
cross-namespace array-capable path support
direct `.size()`/`.get(index)`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/
`.includes(value)`/`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`. Concrete
same-local/same-imported scalar-tree identity remains mandatory for UDT-array
results, and concrete scalar UDT results from unqualified local UDFs may call
the existing pure method subset. Built-in producer element/search readers are
terminal and do not open that method path; only producer `.copy()` may continue
with another allowed array read/copy. The seven fixed cross-namespace producers
and array-returning `matrix.mult` overloads are scalar-array-only and add no
UDT/import identity path. Namespace matrix-returning `matrix.mult` overloads,
exact namespace `matrix.copy`/`matrix.transpose`/`matrix.submatrix`, and
fixed-float namespace `matrix.kron`/`matrix.diff`/`matrix.pow`/`matrix.inv`/
`matrix.pinv`/`matrix.eigenvectors` add
only the five matrix readers/copy above. Copy/transpose/submatrix preserve the
source scalar element kind; transpose swaps shape, submatrix selects a range,
kron expands both dimensions, diff preserves its selected matrix operand's
shape and left-to-right subtraction order, pow preserves square shape across
identity/copy/positive powers, inv preserves square shape for invertible inputs
or yields `na` for singular/invalid-cell inputs, pinv swaps rectangular shape
while preserving singular matrix results, and eigenvectors preserves square
shape or yields `na` for invalid-cell/non-real/incomplete results. All fixed
producers return float matrices. The five exact `matrix.new<T>` templates
instead retain their float/int/bool/string/color matrix kind, rectangular
shape, initial/default-`na` cells, and fresh allocation. None of these paths carries
UDT/import identity. The scalar `map.new<K,V>` and namespace
`map.copy(existing)` result paths likewise carry only scalar map template
metadata and no UDT/import identity. Bound matrix-result receivers other than
exact matrix-receiver
`values.copy()`/`values.transpose()`/`values.submatrix(...)`/
`values.kron(other)`/`values.diff(other)`/`values.pow(power)`/
`values.inv()`/`values.pinv()`/`values.eigenvectors()`/`values.mult(other)`,
unqualified local-UDF results without a concrete supported matrix kind,
local/imported user-method results without a concrete supported matrix kind,
unregistered or unresolved user-function matrix results,
built-in-qualified
or template call results outside
the exact static and dynamic paths, and other
array or matrix methods remain parser/semantic boundaries.
Method side effects, recursive methods, unsupported parameter families,
mismatched UDT parameter identity, unknown receivers, and alias-qualified
imported method receiver type mismatches are rejected during semantic analysis.

### `varip`

```pine
varip ticks = 0
```

The current executable `varip` subset supports global and local scalar
`int`/`float`/`bool`/`string`/`color`/`na` declarations plus scalar typed-array
ids for float, int, bool, string, and color arrays. It also supports explicitly
typed same-local scalar-tree UDT values initialized from `na`, same-UDT
constructors, same-identity aliases, or fixture-backed same-UDT
ternary/switch/if/for/for-in/while expressions, including nested same-local
scalar-tree Wrapper values, plus direct-constructor-inferred
or direct-alias-inferred same-local scalar-tree UDT values such as
`varip p = Point.new(close)` or `varip p = existingPoint`, and scalar-tree
imported UDT values initialized from `na`, same-imported constructors,
same-imported aliases, same-imported ternary/switch/if/for/for-in/while
expressions, including nested same-imported scalar-tree Wrapper values, direct
constructor inference, or direct same-imported alias inference such as
`varip p = lib.Point.new(close)`, same-local scalar-tree UDT array ids,
runtime-owned scalar maps, and
`matrix<float>`/`matrix<int>`/`matrix<bool>`/`matrix<string>`/`matrix<color>`
ids. Local scalar declaration sites
inside `if`, `for`, `while`, and user-defined function bodies use the same
declaration-site storage model as local `var`; each lowered scalar UDF callsite
gets independent storage.
Historical execution treats this subset like `var`: the declaration initializes
once when first reached and reassignment persists across committed bars.

Realtime forming-bar execution differs from ordinary `var`. A first forming
update for a bar starts from the last confirmed runtime state. Repeated forming
updates for that same bar carry `varip` slots forward from the previous forming
update. When a carried `varip` value is a supported array id, the referenced
backing array contents, element kind, and UDT element metadata are copied from
the previous forming runtime as well. Supported map and matrix ids copy their previous forming
backing stores and advance the next id counters past retained ids. Ordinary
`var`, outputs, non-`varip` arrays/maps/matrices, drawing objects, request
caches, callsite state, and history reads continue to roll back to the confirmed
baseline. A confirmed update also seeds from the latest forming `varip` values
before executing and then commits the resulting values into the confirmed
runtime for the next bar.
Committed and realtime forming history reads from supported UDT `varip` values
use the same confirmed-history baseline, including representative same-local and
same-imported nested scalar-tree Wrapper values initialized from ternary
expressions. Single `chart.point` value `varip` history reads use that same
confirmed-history baseline for constant and dynamic offsets.

Skipped local declaration sites do not initialize before their first executed
reach. Assigning a `varip` scalar typed-array slot to another variable preserves
the same array id, so mutations through either name update the same backing
store. `array.copy` returns an independent array id, and a `varip` slot that is
reassigned to that copy retains the copied backing store across repeated forming
updates without aliasing the source. A carried UDT `varip` value is cloned by
value, and scalar field mutation writes the updated field vector back to the
`varip` slot. Array mutation inside UDFs remains rejected by the existing
function side-effect rules except for the exact Pine v4 namespace-call subset
`array.set/pop/unshift/clear`. Drawing object ids are rejected for `varip`:
retaining only the id would be unsafe while label, line, box, and table object
stores continue to roll back between forming updates. Tuples,
non-constructor-inferred UDT `varip`, nested-field UDT `varip`, non-scalar
UDT array `varip`, and other value families remain unsupported until
their declaration-site, backing-store, identity, and rollback rules are
explicitly designed.

Array bounds are stable in the current subset: `array.get`, `array.set`,
`array.insert`, and `array.remove` support negative indexes from the array end.
`array.get`, `array.set`, and `array.insert` also accept per-bar `series int`
indexes.
Indexes outside the current positive or negative bounds are runtime errors.
Positive `array.insert` at `size` appends; greater-than-size insert indexes are
runtime errors.
`array.pop` or `array.shift` on an empty array returns `na`. `array.first` and
`array.last` also return `na` for empty arrays.
`array.fill` replaces all elements by default, or a half-open `[index_from,
index_to)` window when bounds are supplied; invalid ranges are ignored.
`array.includes`, `array.indexof`, and `array.lastindexof` use structural
equality for same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays and same-imported scalar-tree
UDT arrays constructed through `array.from`; `array.indexof` and
`array.lastindexof` return `-1` when no matching value is present. Numeric
binary search helpers expect int/float arrays sorted ascending;
`array.binary_search` returns `-1` when not found, while leftmost/rightmost
return the nearest existing insertion-side index and return `-1` for empty
arrays. `array.every` and `array.some` operate on float/int/bool arrays only:
false, zero, and `na` elements are falsey, other numeric values are truthy,
empty arrays return `true` for `every` and `false` for `some`. Numeric helpers
on int/float arrays skip `na` elements; if every
element is `na` or the array is empty, `array.min`, `array.max`, `array.sum`,
`array.avg`, `array.range`, `array.median`, `array.mode`, `array.variance`,
and `array.stdev` return `na`. `array.range` returns max minus min.
`array.abs` returns a new same-kind int/float array, preserves `na` elements,
and does not mutate the source array.
`array.median` returns the median of non-`na` values. `array.mode` returns the
smallest value among tied most-frequent values and returns `na` when all
remaining values occur only once. Percentile helpers operate on non-`na` values
sorted ascending. Percentages outside `0..=100`, empty/all-`na` arrays, and
invalid `array.percentrank` indexes return `na`.
`array.covariance` requires same-size int/float arrays, skips pairs where
either side is `na`, and returns `na` for mismatched sizes, no numeric pairs,
or unbiased calculations with fewer than two numeric pairs.
`array.standardize` returns a new float array using non-`na` values to compute
mean and population standard deviation. Empty/all-`na` arrays return an empty
array; otherwise `na` element positions are preserved.
`array.variance` and `array.stdev` use a
biased population estimate by default; with `biased=false`, they use the
sample denominator and return `na` when fewer than two numeric values remain.
`array.sort` orders int/float/string arrays in place and supports same-local
scalar-tree UDT arrays plus same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays constructed
through `array.new<lib.Type>` or `array.from`. For UDT arrays, an omitted
`sort_field` selects root field index `0`; a supplied compile-time integer index
or string name must select a root int, float, or string field. It sorts
ascending by default and accepts `order.ascending` or `order.descending`. `na`
values and empty string elements sort last in ascending
order and first in descending order. For UDT arrays this special-value rule
applies to selected field values; an element that is itself `na` raises a
runtime error for both ordering helpers. `array.sort_indices` returns a new int
array containing the source indexes in sorted order, follows the same order and
special-value rules, and leaves the source array unchanged. `array.reverse`
reverses any supported typed array in place.
`array.join` converts supported scalar array elements and fixture-backed
same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array elements to string with the
default numeric format, uses `,` as the default separator, and returns an empty
string for empty arrays. Color elements render as normalized integer color
values. Label and line arrays are intentionally not accepted by
`array.join` or array string conversion in this subset. Joined results over 40,960 characters
are runtime errors.
`array.slice` returns a same-kind shallow window over the parent array's
half-open `[index_from, index_to)` range; reads and writes through the slice
mirror the parent window, inserting through the slice widens that window and
inserts into the parent, negative/reversed/out-of-range creation bounds return
`na`, and later parent mutations that move the window out of bounds are runtime
errors.
`array.concat` appends the second same-kind array to the first array in place
and returns the first array id. A negative array size is a runtime error.
Runtime execution limits each supported array to 100,000 elements; oversized
creation, `array.push`, `array.unshift`, `array.insert`, and `array.concat`
beyond the limit return runtime errors.

Read-only array operations are allowed inside inlined user-defined functions.
The focused Pine v4 namespace-call subset `array.set`, `array.pop`,
`array.unshift`, and `array.clear` also mutates the referenced backing id in
source order. Method-call syntax and every other array mutation inside UDFs
remain rejected as a function side-effect boundary.

For maps, the stored value is a runtime-owned map id. The current runtime
subset supports `map.new<K, V>()` for empty maps whose key and value templates
are `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, or `color`, `map.size(id)` as a
current-entry-count helper, and namespace-call `map.put`, `map.get`,
`map.contains`, `map.clear`, `map.remove`, and `map.copy` over those scalar
templates. Map ids own an insertion-ordered entry list; equal keys replace
existing values, missing `map.get` calls return `na`, `map.contains` reports key
presence, `map.clear` empties the entry list while keeping the id reusable, and
`map.remove` deletes the matching key or no-ops when the key is absent.
Assigning a map to another variable copies the id, not the backing store;
`map.copy` clones the current backing store into an independent map id.
`map.keys` and `map.values` return independent array snapshots in insertion
order. For maps whose key and value templates are each `int`, `float`, `bool`,
`string`, or `color`, those two namespace-call results may be consumed directly
through `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, or `.copy()`. The
returned key/value array kind follows the corresponding map template side;
bool/int/float sides additionally admit `.every()`/`.some()`; numeric sides additionally
admit the three binary searches, `.abs()`, and
terminal `.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.join(separator?)`, plus transforming `.standardize()` and `.sort_indices(order?)` with ordinary array rules. Only
`.copy()`, numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string
`.sort_indices(order?)` can continue into another array chain, and each
is independent of both the map and the first snapshot. Empty maps, typed-`na`
maps, negative
indexes, and bounds errors retain the ordinary array-helper behavior.
`map.put_all(target, source)` mutates the target map by iterating source
entries in insertion order; equal keys replace existing values without moving
target order, and new keys append.
Realtime forming updates start from the confirmed runtime clone, so ordinary
map mutations roll back with the rest of non-`varip` runtime state. Public JSON
output and Python conversion serialize map values as `null`/`None` at output
boundaries. Equivalent method aliases lower to the same supported namespace
calls. Scalar `map<K,V>` typed declarations store the declared key/value
template in semantic metadata and accept `na` or compatible map ids. Scalar map
history reads return independent copies of committed map snapshots, so mutating
the historical id does not mutate the current map or the retained history.
Scalar map `varip` slots retain their map ids and backing stores across repeated
realtime forming updates. Read-only map helpers can consume map ids passed
through user-defined function parameters when semantic analysis can carry the
caller's scalar map template to the parameter. Direct scalar-map `for...in`
iteration visits entries in insertion order; a single loop variable receives the
key, while `[key, value]` receives the key and value. Bare map declarations and
non-scalar map templates remain unsupported.

For matrices, the stored value is a runtime-owned matrix id. The current
runtime subset supports `matrix.new<float>`, `matrix.new<int>`,
`matrix.new<bool>`, `matrix.get`, `matrix.set`,
`matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`, `matrix.reverse`,
`matrix.reshape`, `matrix.kron`, `matrix.mult`, `matrix.diff`, `matrix.pow`,
`matrix.add_row`,
`matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`,
`matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.sort`,
`matrix.submatrix`, `matrix.rows`,
`matrix.columns`, `matrix.elements_count`, `matrix.is_square`,
`matrix.is_binary`, `matrix.is_diagonal`, `matrix.is_identity`,
`matrix.is_symmetric`, `matrix.is_antisymmetric`, `matrix.is_stochastic`,
`matrix.is_zero`, `matrix.sum`, `matrix.avg`, `matrix.min`, `matrix.max`,
`matrix.mode`, `matrix.trace`, `matrix.det`, `matrix.eigenvalues`,
`matrix.eigenvectors`, `matrix.inv`, `matrix.pinv`, `matrix.rank`,
`matrix.row`, and `matrix.col`.
`matrix.new<float>` allocates a fresh rectangular store when executed, fills
cells with the optional numeric/`na` initial value, and coerces int cell values
to float. `matrix.new<int>` allocates a fresh int matrix store with an optional
int-compatible/`na` initial value and is supported with `matrix.get`,
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`,
`matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.submatrix`, `matrix.row`,
`matrix.col`, `matrix.kron`, `matrix.mult`, `matrix.diff`, `matrix.pow`,
`matrix.add_row`, `matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`,
`matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.sort`, `matrix.rows`,
`matrix.columns`, `matrix.elements_count`, and `matrix.is_square`,
`matrix.is_binary`, `matrix.is_diagonal`,
`matrix.is_identity`, `matrix.is_symmetric`, `matrix.is_antisymmetric`,
`matrix.is_stochastic`, `matrix.is_zero`, `matrix.sum`, `matrix.avg`,
`matrix.min`, `matrix.max`, `matrix.mode`, `matrix.trace`, `matrix.det`,
`matrix.eigenvalues`, `matrix.eigenvectors`, `matrix.inv`, `matrix.pinv`, and
`matrix.rank`, including supported method
aliases. `matrix.new<bool>` allocates a fresh bool matrix store with an
optional bool-compatible/`na` initial value and is supported with structural
helpers: `matrix.get`, `matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`,
`matrix.transpose`, `matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.submatrix`,
`matrix.row`, `matrix.col`, `matrix.add_row`, `matrix.add_col`,
`matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`, `matrix.swap_rows`,
`matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.rows`, `matrix.columns`,
`matrix.elements_count`, and `matrix.is_square`, including matching supported
method aliases. Bool matrix writes through `matrix.set`/`matrix.fill` accept
bool or `na` values. Int matrix writes through `matrix.set`/`matrix.fill`
accept int or `na` values. Assigning a matrix to another variable copies the id, not the backing
cells; mutating either name with `matrix.set` or `matrix.fill` mutates the same
runtime-owned matrix. `matrix.copy` allocates an independent store with the
current cells. `matrix.transpose` allocates an independent store with swapped
row and column counts. `matrix.reverse` mutates the existing store in place by
reversing row-major cells, which moves `(row, column)` to
`(rows - 1 - row, columns - 1 - column)`. Ordinary `var` matrix ids persist
across bars, and realtime
forming-bar rollback clones the confirmed matrix store before re-executing
non-`varip` updates. Row and column counts must be non-negative, total cell
count is capped at 100,000, and out-of-bounds row or column access is a runtime
error.
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.add_row`,
`matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`, and
`matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, and `matrix.sort` inside
user-defined functions are rejected as a collection side-effect boundary.
`values.fill(value)` lowers to
`matrix.fill(values, value)` for supported matrix element kinds, `values.get(row, column)`
lowers to `matrix.get(values, row, column)`, `values.set(row, column, value)`
lowers to `matrix.set(values, row, column, value)` while keeping the same UDF
side-effect rejection, `values.copy()` lowers to `matrix.copy(values)`,
`values.transpose()` lowers to `matrix.transpose(values)`, and
`values.reverse()` lowers to `matrix.reverse(values)` with the same UDF
side-effect rejection, and
`values.rows()` / `values.columns()` / `values.elements_count()` /
`values.is_square()` lower to the
corresponding shape readers, while `values.is_binary()`,
`values.is_diagonal()`, `values.is_identity()`, `values.is_symmetric()`,
`values.is_antisymmetric()`, `values.is_stochastic()`, `values.is_zero()`,
`values.sum()`, `values.avg()`, `values.min()`, `values.max()`, and
`values.mode()`, `values.trace()`, `values.det()`, `values.eigenvalues()`,
`values.eigenvectors()`, `values.kron(other)`, `values.inv()`,
`values.mult(other)`, `values.diff(other)`, `values.pow(power)`,
`values.pinv()`, and `values.rank()` lower to the matching
read-only
`matrix.is_binary(values)`,
`matrix.is_diagonal(values)`, `matrix.is_identity(values)`,
`matrix.is_symmetric(values)`, `matrix.is_antisymmetric(values)`,
`matrix.is_stochastic(values)`, `matrix.is_zero(values)`,
`matrix.sum(values)`, `matrix.avg(values)`, `matrix.min(values)`,
`matrix.max(values)`, `matrix.mode(values)`, `matrix.trace(values)`,
`matrix.det(values)`, `matrix.eigenvalues(values)`,
`matrix.eigenvectors(values)`, `matrix.kron(values, other)`,
`matrix.mult(values, other)`, `matrix.diff(values, other)`,
`matrix.pow(values, power)`, `matrix.inv(values)`, `matrix.pinv(values)`, and
`matrix.rank(values)`
helpers.
`matrix.reshape(values, rows, columns)` changes the shape in place while
preserving element order and element count; `values.reshape(rows, columns)`
lowers to the same operation. `matrix.kron(left, right)` accepts runtime-owned
float or int matrix operands and returns an independent `matrix<float>`
Kronecker product whose shape is
`left.rows() * right.rows()` by `left.columns() * right.columns()`, propagates
`na` to result cells when either source cell is `na` or non-finite, preserves
zero-dimension results, and raises a runtime error when the result exceeds the
matrix cell budget. `values.kron(other)` lowers to the same read-only helper.
Matrix-by-matrix `matrix.mult(left, right)` accepts runtime-owned float or int
matrix operands and returns an independent `matrix<float>` product whose shape
is `left.rows()` by `right.columns()`, requires
`left.columns() == right.rows()`, propagates `na` to a result cell when any
contributing source cell is `na` or non-finite, preserves zero-dimension
results, and raises a runtime error on incompatible shapes or when the result
exceeds the matrix cell budget. `values.mult(other)` lowers to the same
read-only helper for matrix or scalar-right operands. When either namespace
operand is a numeric or `na` scalar and the other operand is a matrix,
`matrix.mult` returns an independent same-shape `matrix<float>` with the scalar
multiplied into each numeric cell; `na` or non-finite cells/scalars propagate
to `na`. `matrix.mult(values, vector)` and `values.mult(vector)` accept a
right-hand numeric array as a column vector, require the array size to match the
matrix column count, and return an independent `array<float>` with one element
per matrix row. Each result element is the row/vector dot product; any `na` or
non-finite contributing cell or vector element makes that result element `na`.
Namespace `matrix.mult(vector, values)` accepts a left-hand numeric array as a
row vector, requires the array size to match the matrix row count, and returns
an independent `array<float>` with one element per matrix column. Array-pair
and non-numeric-array `matrix.mult` overloads remain unsupported.
Matrix-by-matrix `matrix.diff(left, right)` accepts runtime-owned float or int
matrix operands and returns an independent `matrix<float>` element-wise
difference whose shape matches both operands, requires identical row and column
counts, propagates `na` to a result cell when either source cell is `na` or
non-finite, preserves zero-dimension results, and raises a runtime error on
incompatible shapes. `values.diff(other)` lowers to the same read-only helper
for matrix or scalar-right operands. When either namespace operand is a numeric
or `na` scalar and the other operand is a matrix, `matrix.diff` returns an
independent same-shape `matrix<float>` using operand order: matrix-left
subtracts the scalar from each numeric cell, while scalar-left subtracts each
numeric cell from the scalar. `na` or non-finite cells/scalars propagate to
`na`.
`matrix.pow(values, power)` accepts runtime-owned square float or int matrices
and returns an independent `matrix<float>` power. Power `0` returns an identity
matrix, power `1` returns an independent copy, and larger powers multiply with
the same `na`/non-finite propagation used by matrix multiplication. Non-square
matrices and negative
powers raise runtime errors; empty `0 x 0` matrices return independent empty
`0 x 0` matrices. `values.pow(power)` lowers to the same read-only helper.
`matrix.elements_count(values)` returns the
current row-count by column-count element count, including zero for
zero-dimension matrices. `matrix.is_square(values)` returns whether the current
row and column counts match. `matrix.is_zero(values)` returns true when every
stored numeric cell is zero, false for any non-zero or `na` cell, and true for
zero-element matrices. `matrix.is_binary(values)` returns true when every
stored numeric cell is exactly zero or one, false for any other numeric value
or `na` cell, and true for zero-element matrices. `matrix.is_diagonal(values)`
returns true when every cell outside the main diagonal is zero, false for any
non-zero or `na` off-diagonal cell, allows any main-diagonal value, does not
require a square shape, and returns true for zero-element matrices.
`matrix.is_identity(values)` returns true only for square matrices whose main
diagonal cells are exactly one and whose other cells are exactly zero, false for
any `na` cell, false for non-square matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0`
matrices.
`matrix.is_symmetric(values)` returns true only for square matrices whose
stored numeric cells match their transposed counterparts, false for any `na`
cell, false for non-square matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0` matrices.
`matrix.is_antisymmetric(values)` returns true only for square matrices whose
main diagonal cells are exactly zero and whose off-diagonal cells are the
negatives of their transposed counterparts, false for any `na` cell, false for
non-square matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0` matrices.
`matrix.is_stochastic(values)` returns true when every cell is a finite
non-negative number and either every row sums exactly to one or every column
sums exactly to one, returns false for any `na` or negative cell, and returns
false for zero-element matrices.
`matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and `matrix<color>` typed
declarations accept compatible matrix values or `na`.
Committed matrix history snapshots return
fresh matrix copies. `matrix.row(values, row)` and
`matrix.col(values, column)` return independent row/column snapshots:
`array<float>` for float matrices, `array<int>` for int matrices,
`array<bool>` for bool matrices, `array<string>` for string matrices, and `array<color>` for color matrices.
The namespace-call results may immediately use `.size()`, `.get(index)`,
`.first()`, `.last()`, or `.copy()` without first binding the snapshot. Only a
postfix `.copy()` can continue into another allowed read/copy; mutating the
postfix copy does not mutate the matrix or an earlier row/column snapshot.
`values.row(row)` lowers to
`matrix.row(values, row)` and returns the same independent row snapshot.
`values.col(column)` lowers to `matrix.col(values, column)` and returns the same
independent column snapshot. `matrix.add_row(values, row, array_id)` copies a
row array with the same element kind as the matrix into the matrix at an
insertion index in `0..=rows`, requires the array length to match the matrix
column count, and remains under the 100,000-cell matrix budget.
`values.add_row(row, array_id)` lowers to the same operation.
`matrix.add_col(values, column, array_id)` copies a column array with the same
element kind as the matrix into the matrix at an insertion index in
`0..=columns`, requires the array length to match the matrix row count, and
remains under the same cell budget. `values.add_col(column, array_id)` lowers
to the same operation.
`matrix.remove_row(values, row)` removes an existing row using the same row
index bounds as `matrix.row`, and `values.remove_row(row)` lowers to the same
operation. `matrix.remove_col(values, column)` removes an existing column using
the same column index bounds as `matrix.col`, and `values.remove_col(column)`
lowers to the same operation. `matrix.swap_rows(values, row1, row2)` swaps two
existing rows in place using row-read bounds, preserves shape, and leaves
same-row or zero-column swaps unchanged after validating both rows.
`values.swap_rows(row1, row2)` lowers to the same operation.
`matrix.swap_columns(values, column1, column2)` swaps two existing columns in
place using column-read bounds, preserves shape, and leaves same-column or
zero-row swaps unchanged after validating both columns.
`values.swap_columns(column1, column2)` lowers to the same operation.
`matrix.sort(values, column?, order?)` reorders complete rows in place by the
selected column, defaults to column `0`, accepts `order.ascending` and
`order.descending`, preserves original row order for equal sort keys, places
`na` keys last ascending and first descending, and validates the selected
column with column-read bounds. `values.sort()`, `values.sort(column)`, and
`values.sort(column, order)` lower to the same operation.
`matrix.submatrix(values, from_row?, to_row?, from_column?, to_column?)`
returns an independent matrix copy of the selected half-open row/column range,
defaulting omitted bounds to the full source matrix. Range indexes accept
`0..=rows` and `0..=columns`, allowing empty row or column slices, and reject
`na`, out-of-bounds, or reversed ranges at runtime. `values.submatrix(...)`
lowers to the same operation.
`matrix.sum(values)` sums numeric cells, ignores
`na` cells, and returns `na` for empty or all-`na` matrices; `matrix.avg(values)`
averages the same non-`na` numeric cell set; `matrix.min(values)` and
`matrix.max(values)` scan the same non-`na` numeric cell set; `matrix.mode(values)`
returns the smallest most-frequent non-`na` numeric cell when a value repeats
and otherwise returns `na`; `matrix.trace(values)` sums non-`na` numeric cells
on the main diagonal over `min(rows, columns)` positions and returns `na` when
the diagonal has no numeric cells; `matrix.det(values)` computes the
determinant of square runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns `1.0` for
empty `0 x 0` matrices, returns `na` for any `na` or non-finite cell, and
raises a runtime error for non-square matrices.
`matrix.eigenvalues(values)` returns an independent `array<float>` of real
eigenvalues for square runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns an empty
array for empty `0 x 0` matrices, returns `na` for any `na` or non-finite cell
and for non-real eigenvalue results, and raises a runtime error for non-square
matrices. Its namespace-call result may immediately use the same closed
read/copy/search helpers plus terminal `.every()`/`.some()`/`.join(separator?)`, numeric `.abs()`, and terminal
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus transforming `.standardize()` and `.sort_indices(order?)`, with
`.copy()`, `.abs()`, `.standardize()`, and `.sort_indices()` nestable and with ordinary empty/
`na` and bounds behavior retained.
`matrix.eigenvectors(values)` returns an independent `matrix<float>` whose
columns are real eigenvectors for square runtime-owned float or int matrices,
returns an independent empty `0 x 0` matrix for empty `0 x 0` input, returns
`na` for any `na` or non-finite cell and for non-real or incomplete eigenvector
results, and raises a runtime error for non-square matrices.
`matrix.inv(values)` computes an independent inverse matrix for non-singular
square runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns an independent empty
`0 x 0` matrix for empty `0 x 0` input, returns `na` for any `na` or non-finite
cell and for singular matrices, and raises a runtime error for non-square
matrices.
`matrix.pinv(values)` computes an independent Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse
matrix with row/column counts swapped from the source, returns an independent
zero-cell matrix for zero-row or zero-column input, returns `na` for any `na`
or non-finite cell, and supports singular and rectangular matrices.
`matrix.rank(values)` computes the rank of rectangular runtime-owned float or
int matrices, returns `0` for zero-element matrices, and returns `na` for any
`na` or non-finite cell.
Matrix method syntax beyond the fixture-backed aliases, matrix templates beyond
`float`, `int`, `bool`, `string`, and `color`, and bare matrix typed declarations
remain outside the executable subset. Matrix `varip` is fixture-backed for the
supported runtime-owned matrix element kinds, with realtime backing-store
handoff matching the general `varip` model.
Matrix allocation rejects negative dimensions and is guarded by the runtime cell
budget before storage is reserved, so invalid or oversized
`matrix.new<T>` calls report deterministic runtime errors.

Supported drawing-object calls currently cover the initial `label.*`, `line.*`,
`box.*`, and `table.*` lifecycles. Labels use deterministic ids, sparse
lifecycle snapshots, creation snapshots with bar-index or bar-time x locations,
price/abovebar/belowbar y locations, official style constants, selected
x-location and y-location snapshot mutation, snapshot cloning, non-reused ids,
and declaration-driven max-count eviction. Lines use the same lifecycle rules with
bar-index x coordinates, price y coordinates,
selected color/width/style and extend fields, snapshot cloning, non-reused ids,
and declaration-driven max-count eviction. `line.new` can initialize existing line
snapshot fields for xloc, extend, color, style, and width when `xloc` is
omitted, `xloc.bar_index`, or `xloc.bar_time`; omitted `color` records the
official `color.blue` default. The chart-point overload uses `point.index` or
`point.time` according to `xloc`; `force_overlay` is accepted but remains a
host display responsibility. Selected `line.set_*` mutators update
endpoint/color/width/style/extend snapshots, and `line.set_xloc` with
`xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` updates the line's x1, x2, and xloc
snapshot values, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks. Boxes use
the same lifecycle rules with bar-index left/right coordinates, price top/bottom
coordinates,
selected background/border fields, snapshot cloning, non-reused ids, and a
declaration-driven max-count eviction. `box.new` can initialize existing box snapshot fields
for xloc, background, border, extend, text, text color, text size, text
alignment, text wrap, font family, and text formatting when `xloc` is omitted,
`xloc.bar_index`, or `xloc.bar_time`; omitted `border_color` and `bgcolor`
record the official `color.blue` default, omitted `text_color` records the
official `color.black` default, and omitted `text_size` records the official
`size.auto` default. The chart-point overload uses `point.index` or `point.time`
according to `xloc`; `force_overlay` is accepted but remains a host display
responsibility.
`box.set_xloc` with `xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` updates the box's left,
right, and xloc snapshot values. Tables use deterministic ids,
fixed positive
dimensions, optional `table.new` background-color, frame-color, frame-width,
border-color, and border-width initialization, accepted `force_overlay` syntax
without public-output propagation or pane routing, and sparse cell snapshots for
text/background/text-color/width/height/text-size writes and final table-level
mutations with `table.set_position` and
`table.set_bgcolor`/`table.set_frame_color`/`table.set_frame_width`/
`table.set_border_color`/`table.set_border_width`, plus
`table.cell_set_text`/`table.cell_set_bgcolor`/
`table.cell_set_text_color`/`table.cell_set_width`/`table.cell_set_height`/
`table.cell_set_text_size`/`table.cell_set_text_halign`/
`table.cell_set_text_valign`/`table.cell_set_text_wrap`/
`table.cell_set_tooltip`/`table.cell_set_text_font_family`/
`table.cell_set_text_formatting` mutations
of previously populated cells and
`table.clear` inclusive rectangular cell-content removal snapshots,
`table.merge_cells` inclusive merged-cell rectangle snapshots, plus
`table.delete` deletion snapshots.
Supported label, line, box, and table id-first drawing functions can also use
Pine method-call syntax. The semantic analyzer and HIR lowering rewrite the
receiver into the first function argument, so `id.set_text("x")` has the same
runtime behavior as `label.set_text(id, "x")` when `id` is a label. This is an
alias for the already supported function subset only; unsupported drawing
methods and unsupported xloc/time variants remain unsupported.
`*.delete(na)`, mutation of `na`, mutation after deletion, and deleting an
already deleted drawing object are no-ops where deletion exists; invalid
non-`na` ids are runtime errors. Labels, lines, boxes, and polylines use the
runtime default 50-object display limit unless their declaration sets a supported
`max_*_count` value; labels, lines, and boxes accept 1 through 500, while
polylines accept 1 through 100. Tables have a 50-object limit and 1000-cell
per-table limit. `label.set_x`, `label.set_y`, `label.set_xy`,
`label.set_point`, `label.set_text`, and `label.set_size` update the latest existing label
snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks. `label.set_point` selects `point.index` when the label's
current `xloc` is `xloc.bar_index`, selects `point.time` when it is
`xloc.bar_time`, and sets `y` from `point.price`. `label.set_color`,
`label.set_textcolor`,
`label.set_style`, `label.set_tooltip`, `label.set_textalign`,
`label.set_text_font_family`, and `label.set_text_formatting` update their
host-neutral snapshot fields, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `label.set_xloc` stores
`xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time`
with the new x-coordinate in the host-neutral snapshot, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks.
`label.set_yloc` stores the selected y-location constant, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks.
`label.set_textalign` stores the selected
horizontal text alignment constant. `label.set_text_font_family` stores the
selected font-family constant. `label.new` can initialize `xloc`, `yloc`,
text, color, official style, text color, size, `textalign`, `text_font_family`,
and a `text_formatting` mask in the host-neutral snapshot; omitted `text`
records an empty string, omitted `color` records the official `color.blue`
default, and omitted `textcolor` records the official `color.white` default. Its
chart-point overload uses `point.index` for `xloc.bar_index`, `point.time` for
`xloc.bar_time`, and `point.price` for y. `force_overlay` is accepted but remains
a host display responsibility.
`label.set_text_formatting` stores the selected
`text.format_none`/`text.format_bold`/`text.format_italic` mask, including
bold+italic combinations. Visual placement for above/below-bar and time/index
coordinates, glyph styling, and text layout remain host responsibilities.
`label.delete` appends an `exists: false` label snapshot, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks.
`label.copy` clones the latest existing label
snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, returns `na` for `na` or deleted
labels, and shares the effective label limit. `label.new` and `label.copy` use
the default 50-label runtime limit when declarations omit `max_labels_count`, or
the named declaration value from 1 through 500, and evict the oldest active
label by appending a deletion snapshot before creating the new label.
`label.get_x` reads the latest
existing label x-coordinate,
including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted labels. `label.get_y` reads the
latest existing label y-coordinate, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted
labels.
`label.get_text` reads the latest existing label text, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted labels. `label.all` returns currently existing label ids in
creation order, including when read from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks after label deletion or max-count eviction. `line.delete` appends an
`exists: false` line snapshot, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `line.copy` clones the latest
existing line snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks,
returns `na` for `na` or deleted lines, and shares the effective line limit.
`line.all` returns currently existing line ids in creation order, including
when read from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks after
line deletion or max-count eviction. `line.new` and `line.copy` keep at most
the effective line limit active by appending `exists: false` snapshots to the
oldest active lines before creating new ones. Omitted declarations use the
runtime's default 50-line display limit; named `max_lines_count` declaration
arguments from 1 through 500 are parsed into HIR for indicators and strategies
and consumed by this line eviction path.
`line.get_x1` reads the latest existing line x1 value, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted lines.
`line.get_y1` reads the latest existing line y1 value, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted lines.
`line.get_x2` reads the latest existing line x2 value, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted lines.
`line.get_y2` reads the latest existing line y2 value, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted lines.
`line.get_price` reads the latest existing bar-index line snapshot, including
when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks,
applies x1/y1/x2/y2 interpolation or extrapolation for the requested x value,
and returns `na` for `na`, deleted, vertical, nonnumeric, or time-coordinate
lines; timestamp interpolation remains unsupported. `box.copy` clones the latest
existing box snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, returns `na` for `na`
or deleted boxes, and shares the effective box limit. `box.new` and `box.copy`
use the default 50-box runtime limit when declarations omit `max_boxes_count`,
or the named declaration value from 1 through 500, and evict the oldest active
box by appending a deletion snapshot before creating the new box. `box.delete`
removes the latest existing box snapshot, including when called from ordinary
and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and deleting `na` or already
deleted boxes is a no-op. `box.all` returns currently existing box ids in
creation order, including when read from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks after box deletion or max-count eviction. `box.set_left`,
`box.set_top`,
`box.set_right`, `box.set_bottom`, `box.set_lefttop`, and
`box.set_rightbottom` update the host-neutral geometry snapshot, including when
called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks.
`box.set_bgcolor`, `box.set_border_color`, `box.set_border_width`,
`box.set_border_style`, and `box.set_extend` update the host-neutral style
snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks; visual extension remains a host responsibility.
`box.set_xloc` with `xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` updates the box's left,
right, and xloc values in the host-neutral snapshot, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `box.set_text` records
the box text string in the
host-neutral snapshot. `box.set_text_color` records the text color in the
host-neutral snapshot. `box.set_text_size` records the selected size constant in
the host-neutral snapshot. `box.set_text_halign` records the selected horizontal
alignment constant in the host-neutral snapshot. `box.set_text_valign` records
the selected vertical alignment constant in the host-neutral snapshot.
`box.set_text_wrap` records the selected wrapping constant in the host-neutral
snapshot. `box.set_text_font_family` records the selected font-family constant
in the host-neutral snapshot. `box.set_text_formatting` records the selected
`text.format_none`/`text.format_bold`/`text.format_italic` mask, including
bold+italic combinations. These text snapshot setters apply when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks; text rendering, glyph
styling, and font layout remain host responsibilities. `box.get_left` reads the
latest existing box left value,
including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted boxes. `box.get_right` reads the
latest existing box right value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or
deleted boxes. `box.get_top` reads the latest existing box top value, including
when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and
returns `na` for `na` or deleted boxes. `box.get_bottom` reads the latest
existing box bottom value, including when called from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted boxes.
`table.set_position`
updates the table's final position value, including when called from ordinary
and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.set_bgcolor` updates the
table's final background color value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.set_frame_color` updates the
table's final frame-color value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.set_frame_width` updates the
table's final frame-width value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.set_border_color` updates
the table's final border-color value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.set_border_width` updates
the table's final border-width value, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.new` optional
`bgcolor`,
`frame_color`, `frame_width`, `border_color`, and `border_width` initialize the
table's final background-color, frame-color, frame-width, border-color, and
border-width values. `force_overlay` is accepted, but its value is not exposed
in public output and pane routing remains unsupported.
`table.delete` appends an `exists: false` table snapshot, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.clear`
removes already populated cells
in the inclusive rectangular range from `start_column`,
`start_row` to `end_column`, `end_row`, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks; it also removes merged-cell records
that intersect the cleared range, while preserving the table object and
table-level style fields.
`table.merge_cells` appends inclusive
`start_column`/`start_row` to `end_column`/`end_row` merge rectangles to the
host-neutral table snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks; deleted or `na` table ids are no-ops, invalid
non-`na` ids are runtime
errors, and out-of-bounds, reversed, or overlapping merge ranges are runtime
errors. Later table-level or cell mutations of deleted
tables are no-ops.
`table.all` returns currently existing table ids in creation order, including
when read from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks after
table deletion.
`table.set_bgcolor`, `table.set_frame_color`, `table.set_frame_width`,
`table.set_border_color`, and `table.set_border_width` update the table's final
style values; visual anchoring, border rendering, and layout remain host
responsibilities. `table.cell_set_text`, `table.cell_set_bgcolor`,
`table.cell_set_text_color`, `table.cell_set_width`, `table.cell_set_height`,
`table.cell_set_text_size`, `table.cell_set_text_halign`,
`table.cell_set_text_valign`, `table.cell_set_text_wrap`,
`table.cell_set_tooltip`, `table.cell_set_text_font_family`, and
`table.cell_set_text_formatting` update the target previously populated cell in
the host-neutral table snapshot, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, while preserving the cell's other
supported fields; actual table layout, text rendering, text layout, wrapping,
tooltip display, font rendering, and bold/italic rendering remain host
responsibilities.

Drawing side effects are allowed in top-level control flow, including supported
`if`, `switch`, `for`, and `while` bodies. Realtime forming updates start from
the confirmed runtime snapshot, so unconfirmed label, line, box, and table
creation, mutation, deletion, and cell writes are rolled back when a new forming
update arrives.
Pine v4 UDF bodies admit the exact namespace-call drawing subset `label.new`,
`label.delete`, `line.new`, and `line.delete`; inlined calls write the ordinary
runtime object stores and therefore share the same rollback behavior. Other
drawing side effects inside UDFs remain rejected under the same boundary as
global-only output calls.

## Request Data

`request.security` is supported only for the matrix-backed subset. The runtime
does not fetch data. Hosts inject immutable requested bar streams through the
request provider contract, keyed by symbol and timeframe, and the runtime
validates duplicate keys plus sorted unique bar times before execution.

The provider environment also owns explicit chart identity. CLI callers use
`--chart-symbol` and `--chart-timeframe`; Python callers use the optional
`chart_symbol` and `chart_timeframe` keywords on `run_script` or `Program.run`;
WASM callers place an optional reserved `$chart` object with string `symbol`
and `timeframe` fields in the request-bars JSON object. Omitted identity uses
the deterministic default chart. Invalid or empty metadata is rejected by the
host boundary before runtime.

Same-context requests whose symbol and timeframe match the chart metadata
evaluate the requested expression in the chart context. Provider-backed
same-or-higher-timeframe requests evaluate the supported expression in an
isolated requested-context runtime over the provider bars. Requested-context
state is separate from chart-context state: history buffers, `ta.*` callsite
state, `var` storage, arrays, drawing objects, and outputs do not leak between
the two contexts.

The same-context identity form also supports tuple literals made from
side-effect-free elements and selected tuple-returning calls when destructured
directly. The selected tuple-returning calls currently include `ta.macd`,
`ta.bb`, `ta.kc`, `ta.supertrend`, `ta.dmi`, and
`ta.vwap(source, anchor, stdev_mult)`.

The supported provider requested expression subset includes requested-context
`syminfo.tickerid`/`timeframe.period`, direct OHLCV/time sources,
pure arithmetic and ternaries, history references, `na`, `nz`, selected
stateless `math.*` calls, fixed-mintick `math.round_to_mintick`, `math.sum`,
`ta.cum`, `ta.sma`, `ta.ema`, `ta.dema`, `ta.tema`, `ta.rma`, `ta.rsi`,
`ta.accdist`, `ta.iii`, `ta.nvi`, `ta.obv`, `ta.pvi`, `ta.pvt`, `ta.wvad`,
`ta.tsi`, `ta.cmo`, `ta.cci`, `ta.cog`, `ta.bop`, `ta.ao`, `ta.max`, `ta.min`, `ta.mfi`, `ta.stoch`, `ta.wpr`, `ta.sar`, `ta.tr` function calls, `ta.atr`, `ta.highest`, `ta.lowest`, `ta.highestbars`, `ta.lowestbars`, `ta.change`, `ta.mom`, `ta.roc`, `ta.range`, `ta.dev`, `ta.vwap`,
`ta.bbw`, `ta.kcw`, `ta.pivothigh`, `ta.pivotlow`, `ta.correlation`,
`ta.covariance`, `ta.median`, `ta.mode`, `ta.percentile_nearest_rank`,
`ta.percentile_linear_interpolation`,
`ta.percentrank`, `ta.stdev`, `ta.variance`, `ta.wma`, `ta.vwma`, `ta.swma`,
`ta.hma`, `ta.alma`, `ta.linreg`, `ta.rising`, `ta.falling`, `ta.barssince`, `ta.valuewhen`,
`ta.cross`, `ta.crossover`, and `ta.crossunder`.
Rolling callsite state for `math.sum` and `ta.*` calls is owned by the isolated
requested context. Stateful math calls such as `math.random` and the `ta.tr`
variable form remain outside the requested-expression subset.
Provider-backed tuple literals whose elements are in the supported scalar subset
are supported when destructured directly from the request. Selected
provider-backed tuple-returning calls are also supported, currently `ta.macd`,
`ta.bb`, `ta.kc`, `ta.supertrend`, `ta.dmi`, and
`ta.vwap(source, anchor, stdev_mult)`. Other provider-backed tuple expressions
remain unsupported.

Requested-context results are cached deterministically by callsite, requested
symbol, requested timeframe, and expression identity for the duration of one
runtime execution. Repeated identical calls reuse that cache instead of
mutating provider data or chart state.

Same-timeframe modern provider requests use default `gaps_off`: the most recent
requested value whose open is not later than the chart open is carried forward.
Higher-timeframe modern provider requests use default `gaps_off` and
`lookahead_off`: a requested value is visible only after the requested bar has
closed relative to the current chart bar, missing confirmed requested bars
forward-fill the last confirmed requested value, and chart bars before the
first confirmed requested bar return `na`.

### Legacy `security`

Accepted v1-v4 `security` calls reuse the same provider, requested-expression,
cache, and state-isolation machinery after a version-specific signature binder.
The executable call is intentionally lowered to an inaccessible internal HIR
name whose suffix encodes `gaps_off|gaps_on` and
`lookahead_off|lookahead_on`; it is not lowered to a public modern call with
silently widened arguments. Runtime failures retain hidden start/end arguments
for the original complete source call.

The verified merge behavior is:

| Context | `lookahead_off` | historical `lookahead_on` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| same timeframe, `gaps_off` | latest requested open not after chart open | same |
| same timeframe, `gaps_on` | exact requested/chart open | same |
| higher timeframe, `gaps_off` | latest requested close not after chart close | latest requested open not after chart open |
| higher timeframe, `gaps_on` | requested close equals chart close | requested open equals chart open |

Pine v1/v2 profiles default to lookahead on; Pine v3/v4 profiles default to
lookahead off. Explicit compile-time bools and matching `barmerge` constants
select gaps/lookahead where the historical signature exposes those arguments.
For realtime forming and confirmed updates, legacy lookahead-on uses confirmed
lookahead-off alignment, matching the historical/realtime handoff instead of
exposing an unconfirmed future value. A program that actually reaches a
lookahead-on call emits `W_LEGACY_SECURITY_LOOKAHEAD` once for that callsite.
Warnings are returned in stable callsite order and do not make execution fail.

The requested child runtime receives chart metadata for the requested symbol
and timeframe, and its warnings are merged into the outer result. Mutable
requested state, histories, arrays, drawings, `var` values, and stateful
callsites stay separate from chart state. Missing streams and invalid timeframe
relations are stable runtime errors; a legacy error begins with
`legacy security at source span START..END:` across the host-specific error
wrapper.

For the focused Pine v4 direct-UDF subset, immutable declaration initializers
inside the inlined function remain discoverable by their unique HIR symbols.
When such a symbol is used by `security`, series parameters and locals are
recomputed in the requested child runtime, while const/input/simple parameters
and locals are captured from the reached outer call. A prior legacy request
result is an admissible dependency only for the three-positional-argument form
whose evaluated symbol/timeframe and encoded gaps/lookahead selector are
identical to the enclosing request; it therefore becomes same-context when the
dependency graph is evaluated. Different selectors, control-flow-local calls,
mutable/persistent locals, recursion, and side effects are rejected before HIR.

The exact Pine v4 `study(resolution="")` subset inherits the supplied chart
symbol and timeframe. Its declaration-only `resolution` and literal-bool
`resolution_gaps` arguments are removed before canonical `indicator` lowering,
so the whole script executes directly on chart bars and no request stream is
consulted. Batch, incremental, and realtime historical handoff are paired with
a v6 canonical fixture. Non-empty or dynamic declaration timeframes remain one
focused unsupported feature: they require a program-level coordinator for
whole-script state, output alignment, gaps, realtime confirmation, provider
identity, and cache ownership. Treating them as a synthetic
`request.security` expression would not preserve those semantics.

Lower-timeframe `request.security`/legacy `security`,
`request.security_lower_tf`, modern non-default gaps/lookahead, advanced
request families, modern provider local aliases and UDF calls,
output/drawing/alert side effects, input declarations, and array mutation
inside requested expressions remain unsupported.

### `varip`

Scalar, scalar typed-array, single `chart.point` value, same-local scalar-tree
UDT array, explicitly typed same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT, and
direct-constructor-inferred or direct-alias-inferred same-local or same-imported
scalar-tree UDT `varip` declarations use the intrabar persistence model
described above. The explicitly typed UDT subset
includes `na`, same-UDT constructors, same-identity aliases, and fixture-backed
same-UDT ternary/switch/if/for/for-in/while initializers, including nested
same-local and same-imported scalar-tree Wrapper values. Drawing object ids are rejected before runtime because their
object stores are not part of the `varip` handoff; tuples,
broader untyped non-constructor-inferred UDT expressions, nested-field UDT values, non-scalar UDT
array `varip`, and other value families remain rejected until their
realtime state partitions are designed. The closed Phase I boundary for the
original scalar and scalar
typed-array subset is recorded in
`docs/PHASE_I_AUDIT.md`.

## User-Defined Functions

Expression-body user-defined functions are lowered by inlining the body at each
callsite:

```pine
smooth(src, len) => ta.sma(src, len)
plot(smooth(close, 20))

spread(hi, lo) => hi - lo
plot(spread(lo=low, hi=high))

range2(hi, lo) =>
    value = hi - lo
    value * 2

select_value(x, y) =>
    result = y
    if x > y
        result := x
    result
```

Inlining gives stateful calls inside the function body independent callsite
state for each syntactic UDF call. Named arguments are resolved before
lowering, and arguments are evaluated once into callsite-local temporaries.
Multi-statement function bodies execute local statements and return the final
expression. Local declarations and reassignments inside function block bodies
are scoped to the function callsite. A local declaration or loop counter can
shadow a parameter without changing references that were already resolved to
that parameter. Pine v4 UDF bodies may execute the focused
reference-side-effect namespace subset `array.set/pop/unshift/clear`,
`label.new/delete`, and `line.new/delete`. Recursive functions, global-only
output side effects, alert side effects, all other collection/drawing side
effects, global reassignment inside functions, and side-effecting calls as UDF
arguments remain rejected.

## Series and History References

History references use committed values:

```pine
close[1]
x[2]
```

Rules:

- Offset `0` refers to the current value.
- Positive offsets refer to previous committed bars.
- Out-of-range references return `na` unless the feature later needs stricter
  runtime errors for selected cases.
- Dynamic `na` offsets return `na`, but still evaluate the source expression on
  the current bar so expression and UDF-result series histories stay aligned.
- Dynamic offsets should be supported only after constant offsets are correct.
  Runtime profiles count dynamic history reads whose requested offset exceeds
  the effective retained depth in `historyDynamicRetentionMisses` and expose
  their maximum requested offset as `historyDynamicRetentionMaxMissedOffset`;
  those reads still return `na` in the current subset.

History can apply to variables, built-in series, and accepted expressions. Any
expression that needs history must have stable series storage assigned before
runtime execution. See [`SERIES_MODEL.md`](SERIES_MODEL.md).

Array variable history is supported for the fixture-backed scalar array,
scalar slice, label-array, label-slice, line-array, line-slice, box-slice,
linefill-array, linefill-slice, polyline-array, polyline-slice, box-array,
table-array, table-slice, and chart.point-array and chart.point-slice read
paths, including the official `previous = a[1]` and
`na(previous) ? na : previous.get(0)` pattern. When a
retained series value is an array id, runtime stores an independent array
snapshot for history and returns a fresh copy from positive-offset history
reads, so reading or mutating the historical copy does not alias the current
array id. Broader array-history edges, including future collection families and
richer mutation/aliasing cases, remain outside the current contract.

## `na`

`na` must be a first-class runtime value.

Rules:

- Arithmetic involving `na` usually produces `na`.
- Comparisons involving `na` should follow Pine-compatible behavior.
- Functions such as `nz()` and `na()` must be implemented deliberately, not as
  ordinary Python or Rust null checks.

## Inputs

Inputs are stable across a run:

```pine
generic = input(20, "Length")
length = input.int(20, "Length")
mode = input.string("SMA", "Mode")
start = input.time(0, "Start")
```

The analyzer accepts the supported input metadata subset and inputs carry the
`input` qualifier. Runtime execution evaluates each input's `defval` unless the
Rust runtime is run with call-site keyed `InputOverrides`, the CLI supplies
`--input-override CALL_SITE_ID=value`, or the Python host supplies a call-site
keyed `input_overrides` dictionary to `Program.run()` or `run_script()`, or the
WASM host supplies an `inputOverridesJson` object to a `*WithInputOverrides` run
API. Host-side `input.source` overrides are not implemented yet.

## Built-In OHLCV Series

The initial runtime should provide:

```text
open
high
low
close
volume
time
hl2
hlc3
ohlc4
bar_index
```

Each is a series value with a current value on each bar.

## Plotting Side Effects

Plot functions should not render charts. They should collect normalized output.

Examples:

```pine
p = plot(ta.sma(close, 20), color=color.orange)
h = hline(70)
fill(p, h)
```

The runtime currently collects normalized output fields, not full TradingView
rendering metadata:

- `plot`: numeric values and id.
- `hline`: price and id.
- `fill`: first/second plot or hline ids.
- `barcolor` and `bgcolor`: color values and id.
- `plotchar`: marker values, chars, and colors.
- `plotshape`: marker values, styles, locations, colors, texts, text colors,
  and sizes.
- `plotarrow`: marker values, up/down colors, min heights, and max heights.
- `plotbar`: open, high, low, close, and color values.
- `plotcandle`: open, high, low, close, body colors, wick colors, and border
  colors.
- `label.*`: deterministic label ids and sparse creation, mutation, and
  deletion snapshots for the supported label subset.
- `line.*`: deterministic line ids and sparse creation, mutation, and deletion
  snapshots for the supported line subset.
- `box.*`: deterministic box ids and sparse creation, mutation, and deletion
  snapshots for the supported box subset.
- `table.*`: deterministic table ids, dimensions, and sparse cell snapshots for
  the supported table subset.

Accepted metadata such as `offset`, `show_last`, `display`, `force_overlay`,
and `editable` does not yet transform, filter, or annotate these output series.
`plot` `style` is evaluated each bar and stored as a single metadata field; the
final evaluated documented enum is the value hosts see. Per-bar style series
are not emitted. `plotshape` `style` is a per-bar series. `hline` `linestyle`
uses the same last-evaluated metadata rule as `plot` `style`.
`linefill.new` creates runtime-owned linefill ids over supported line ids,
emits sparse color snapshots, and replaces the previous linefill for the same
line pair. `linefill.set_color` appends sparse color mutation snapshots for
existing linefill ids, while `na` ids and already-replaced linefill ids are
no-ops. `linefill.get_line1` and `linefill.get_line2` return the referenced
line ids for existing linefill ids; `na` ids and already-replaced linefill ids
return `na`. `linefill.delete` appends an `exists: false` snapshot for existing
linefill ids and is a no-op for `na`, replaced, or already deleted ids.
`linefill.all` returns a snapshot array of currently existing linefill ids in
creation order and omits linefills replaced by later same-pair creations or
deleted by `linefill.delete`. `array.new_linefill`, `array.from` over linefill
ids, and generic object-array mutation/search/read helpers support linefill
arrays with shallow reference elements. Numeric, truth, sorting, and string
join helpers remain limited to their existing scalar-compatible array families.
`chart.point` values have a fixture-backed execution model for constructors,
`copy`, `time`/`index`/`price` field reads, top-level field mutation, and
`array.new<chart.point>()` plus `array.from(chart.point, ...)` point-array
storage/read/mutation/search. `line.new` can create line snapshots from two
`chart.point` values, selecting `point.index` for `xloc.bar_index` and
`point.time` for `xloc.bar_time`, while retaining the existing line style,
extend, color, and width snapshot fields. `box.new` can create box snapshots
from two `chart.point` values using the same `xloc` coordinate selection while
retaining the existing box style, text, and fill snapshot fields, including the
official default `color.blue` for omitted `border_color`/`bgcolor`, `color.black`
for omitted `text_color`, and `size.auto` for omitted `text_size`. `label.new`
can create label snapshots from one `chart.point`, selecting `point.index` for
`xloc.bar_index` and `point.time` for `xloc.bar_time`, while using
`point.price` for y and retaining the existing label text/style fields,
including the empty-string default for omitted `text`, the official default
`color.blue` for omitted `color`, and `color.white` for omitted `textcolor`.
`line.set_first_point` and
`line.set_second_point` update the selected endpoint from a `chart.point`,
using the line's current `xloc` to choose `point.index` or `point.time` for the
x-coordinate. `box.set_top_left_point` and `box.set_bottom_right_point` update
the selected corner from a `chart.point`, using the box's current `xloc` to
choose `point.index` or `point.time` for the x-coordinate. `label.set_point`
updates a label's x/y coordinates from a `chart.point`, using the label's
current `xloc` to choose `point.index` or `point.time` for x and `point.price`
for y. `polyline.new`
creates runtime-owned polyline ids from an
`array<chart.point>` input, copies the current point-list values into a
host-neutral `polylines[].snapshots[]` entry, and records `curved`, `closed`,
`xloc`, `lineColor`, `fillColor`, `lineStyle`, `lineWidth`, and
`forceOverlay`. When `line_color` is omitted, `polyline.new` records the
official default `color.blue`; omitted `fill_color` remains `na`.
`polyline.delete` appends an `exists: false` snapshot for an existing id and
treats `na` or already-deleted ids as no-ops.
`polyline.all`
returns currently existing polyline ids in creation order. Realtime forming-bar
updates roll back abandoned polyline creations, deletions, copied point lists,
and `polyline.all` reads from the last confirmed drawing state. The historical
runtime keeps at most the effective polyline limit active by appending
`exists: false` snapshots to the oldest active polylines before creating new
ones. Omitted declarations use the runtime's default 50-polyline display limit;
named `max_polylines_count` declaration arguments from 1 through 100 are parsed
into HIR for indicators and strategies and consumed by this polyline eviction
path. The current polyline id array subset is fixture-backed through
`array.new_polyline`, official `array.new<polyline>` template syntax,
typed `array<polyline>`/`polyline[]` declarations, `array.from(polyline, ...)`,
and generic object-array storage, mutation, read, search, copy, slice, concat,
reverse, clear, and array/slice history snapshots.

## Determinism

A compiled program must produce the same result for the same bars and inputs.
Host time, network access, randomness, and file system access should not exist
in the core runtime.

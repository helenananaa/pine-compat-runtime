# Conformance

This document defines how compatibility is measured.

The project should make compatibility claims by tested feature, not by broad
language name.

## Fixture Categories

Fixtures should be grouped by behavior:

```text
tests/fixtures/
  syntax/
  sema/
  runtime/
  builtins/
  unsupported/
  regressions/
```

Each fixture should include:

- source script
- expected diagnostics or expected output
- selected Pine version
- fixture ownership or license metadata when not original

## Snapshot Outputs

Runtime snapshots should be normalized JSON:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 8,
  "plots": [],
  "plotChars": [],
  "plotShapes": [],
  "plotArrows": [],
  "plotBars": [],
  "plotCandles": [],
  "bgColors": [],
  "barColors": [],
  "hlines": [],
  "fills": [],
  "labels": [],
  "lines": [],
  "lineFills": [],
  "polylines": [],
  "boxes": [],
  "tables": [],
  "alerts": [],
  "diagnostics": []
}
```

The snapshot format should avoid host-specific charting details.

Every machine-readable public output must include top-level `schemaVersion`.
Runtime outputs use `PUBLIC_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION`; analysis outputs use
`PUBLIC_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA_VERSION`; matrix JSON uses
`PUBLIC_MATRIX_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Runtime output is currently `schemaVersion: 8`
because the top-level `alerts` array is reserved, strategy order-fill alert
payloads are exposed under `strategy.alerts`, table cell snapshots include
host-neutral `textWrap`, linefill snapshots are exposed under `lineFills`, and
polyline creation and lifecycle snapshots are exposed under `polylines`; plot,
marker, bar, candle, color, hline, and fill outputs also expose normalized
visual series and fixture-backed metadata;
runtime results also carry `renderMetadataVersion: 1` so hosts can distinguish
native visual metadata from host defaults. Analysis JSON is currently
`schemaVersion: 5`; in addition to top-level `inputs` callsite metadata, it
exposes compile-time defaults, constraints, and options plus validated
language-version origin, dialect, script mode, and reserved legacy
translation/emulation evidence. Matrix JSON
remains `schemaVersion: 2`.
The contracts are separate so runtime-only fields do not force analysis or
matrix schema changes. CLI `analyze --format json`, Python analysis
dictionaries, and WASM analysis JSON project this same analysis contract; the
default CLI text report remains diagnostic console output.

Legacy host parity has two explicit baselines. CLI runtime fixtures generate
the ordinary `runtime_*.json` goldens listed in
`scripts/host_parity_required.txt`. CLI legacy analysis fixtures generate the
complete `analysis_legacy_*.json` reports listed in
`scripts/legacy_analysis_parity_required.txt`. Python and WASM must assert every
required golden, and `scripts/check_host_parity.py` fails missing registrations,
missing host assertions, duplicate entries, unrecorded pairs, or runtime /
analysis name collisions. Analysis comparisons use complete parsed JSON values,
so every schema field and value must agree without treating object-key order as
semantic.

## Legacy Indicator Release Profiles

`tests/fixtures/legacy/release_profiles.tsv` is the release execution registry.
It contains 33 complete legacy runtime fixtures and three additional MTF rows.
Every row pins source version, maturity, bars/request/execution environment,
realtime policy, original-source provenance, and a retained-value ceiling. The
runtime release test fails if a legacy runtime fixture is missing from the
registry, if a row changes maturity or provenance unexpectedly, or if
execution diverges across its required modes.

| Profile | Maturity | Eligible corpus | Release rows | Historical/incremental | Realtime policy |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| v4 | preview | 12 | 24 | exact parity | forming/rollback/confirmed parity |
| v3 | preview | 7 | 2 | exact parity | forming/rollback/confirmed parity |
| v2 | experimental | 2 | 4 | exact parity | ordinary rows parity; lookahead row forbids future leakage |
| implicit v1 | experimental | 1 | 6 | exact parity | forming/rollback/confirmed parity |

The fixed seed corpus has 22 eligible legacy indicators and six controls plus
one excluded legacy strategy. It reaches 100% parse, analyze/lower, and
historical-run success with zero unknown diagnostics, but it is small and has
no external reference-output oracle. The provisional stable gate requires at
least 50 authorized eligible scripts per profile when samples are available;
therefore no v1-v4 profile is labeled stable. A passing feature row means that
the named fixture-backed behavior is supported, not that its enclosing
language profile is stable.

`scripts/profile_legacy_release.py` performs an indicative end-to-end CLI
analysis timing pass and consumes public runtime profiles to count retained
series/window/output values. Timing is observational and machine-dependent;
the per-row resource ceiling is deterministic and release-gated. Corpus and
release manifests require explicit license classes and source paths, and
privacy-preserving corpus reports omit source text and source paths.
Corpus report schema 4 also records `executionTimes` availability and
three-mode aggregate resource/cache evidence while omitting execution-time
paths, timestamp values, request keys, and provider values. A non-empty
`execution_times_path` manifest field must resolve to a file before execution
and is forwarded unchanged through CLI `--execution-times`.

The public v4 seed count remains 12 in the maturity table. A separate
version-aware, privacy-preserving dedup audit proves that the 20 authorized
private v4 selections do not duplicate those seeds at the exact, normalized,
or token-equivalent levels, producing 32 countable v4 samples. This is still
below the 50-script stable gate and does not move private sources into the
committed conformance registry.

Legacy exact-alias conformance requires a paired source/canonical HIR or runtime
comparison, an original-span translation record, a user-symbol collision
control, and a v5/v6 negative control. Catalog validation must also prove that
canonical targets exist and version ranges neither overlap nor enter modern
dialects. Phase 2 exercises these requirements with a synthetic catalog only;
production alias rows become support claims only when their owning phase adds
fixtures and conformance metadata.

The current pure-internal call-result subset normalizes an unqualified plain
local UDF receiver through the parser-only `$call_result` prefix, exact static
built-in array producers through `$builtin_array_result`, and the five exact
`matrix.new<float|int|bool|string|color>` templates plus namespace
`matrix.copy(...)`/`matrix.transpose(...)`/`matrix.submatrix(...)`/
`matrix.kron(...)`/`matrix.diff(...)`/`matrix.pow(...)`/`matrix.inv(...)`/
`matrix.pinv(...)`/`matrix.eigenvectors(...)`/`matrix.mult(...)` candidates through
`$builtin_matrix_result`. Exact supported scalar `map.new<K,V>` templates and
exact namespace `map.copy(existing)` results use the separate
`$builtin_map_result` prefix. Local UDF,
qualified user-defined UDF/method, and admitted built-in producer results can
use only `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, and `.copy()` for
currently supported array kinds. Namespace `matrix.mult(...)` results that
resolve to a matrix and namespace `matrix.copy(...)` results can instead use
the same set as namespace `matrix.transpose(...)`, `matrix.submatrix(...)`,
`matrix.kron(...)`, `matrix.diff(...)`, `matrix.pow(...)`, `matrix.inv(...)`,
`matrix.pinv(...)`, and `matrix.eigenvectors(...)` results: `.rows()`, `.columns()`,
`.elements_count()`, `.get(row, column)`, `.copy()`, `.submatrix(...)`, and
`.transpose()`, plus terminal `.set(row, column, value)`, `.fill(value)`, `.reverse()`, `.reshape(rows, columns)`, `.add_row(row, array_id)`, `.add_col(column, array_id)`, numeric-only `.sort(column?, order?)`, `.swap_rows(row1, row2)`, `.swap_columns(column1, column2)`, `.remove_row(row)`, and `.remove_col(column)`. Numeric results
additionally admit `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`,
`.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)`.
Unqualified local-UDF results that infer a concrete supported matrix kind use
that same forty-four-helper closed set through `$call_result`, subject to
the numeric-only checks; parameter passthrough,
block aliases, nested calls, same-kind control flow, matrix operations, and
constructors retain call-specific float/int/bool/string/color kinds.
`.copy()`, numeric `.diff(other)`/`.eigenvectors()`/`.inv()`/`.kron(other)`/`.mult(other)`/`.pinv()`/`.pow(power)`,
`.submatrix(...)`, and `.transpose()` may continue. Local and
imported user-method results with a concrete supported matrix kind share the
same closed helpers through recorded method-call
provenance, including receiver-style, local-type-qualified or alias-qualified,
direct-constructor-receiver, block/nested/control-flow, dual-alias, and nested
copy paths. Registered imported pure-function results with a concrete supported
matrix kind also share them across alias-qualified, block/nested/
control-flow, five-kind, dual-alias, and nested-copy paths. Unregistered or
unresolved user-function matrix results do not enter these paths.
`matrix.copy` preserves shape, while `matrix.transpose` swaps shape; both
preserve the source's supported matrix element kind. `matrix.submatrix`
preserves that element kind while returning the selected half-open range.
`matrix.kron` always produces an independent expanded-shape `matrix<float>`
from two numeric matrices.
`matrix.diff` produces an independent `matrix<float>` with the selected matrix
operand's shape and preserves left-to-right subtraction order.
`matrix.pow` produces an independent square `matrix<float>` for identity,
copy, and positive integer powers.
`matrix.inv` produces an independent square `matrix<float>`, empty `0 x 0`, or
`na` for singular/invalid-cell inputs; non-square inputs retain the runtime
shape error.
`matrix.pinv` produces an independent fixed `matrix<float>`, swaps rectangular
row/column counts, preserves singular matrix-valued results and swapped zero-
cell shapes, and yields `na` for invalid-cell inputs.
`matrix.eigenvectors` produces an independent square `matrix<float>` whose
columns are real complete eigenvectors, or `na` for invalid-cell, non-real, or
incomplete results.
Each admitted `matrix.new<T>` template produces a fresh matrix with its
float/int/bool/string/color element kind, requested rectangular shape,
type-compatible initial value or default `na`, and the same seven direct
all-kind read/copy/submatrix/transpose helpers. Numeric templates additionally
admit `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` with copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation.
Admitted scalar map results expose `.size()`, terminal `.put(key, value)`,
`.clear()`, `.remove(key)`, and `.put_all(source)`, `.get(key)`, `.contains(key)`, `.copy()`,
`.keys()`, and `.values()`, retain
known scalar key/value kinds, and allow only `.copy()` to continue another map
read/copy. `.put(...)` validates both concrete scalar kinds, replaces an
existing value without moving its key or appends a new insertion-order entry,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. Fresh constructor, copy, imported-
function, and imported-method results isolate the write; local UDF and local
user-method alias results update shared storage. `.clear()` empties the same
backing entry list, returns `void`, and cannot continue, with the same alias-
versus-fresh storage split.
`.remove(...)` validates the concrete key kind, deletes the matching entry
without disturbing the order of retained keys, no-ops for a missing key,
returns `void`, and uses the same alias-versus-fresh storage split.
`.put_all(...)` requires the exact same key/value template, clones source
entries before merging so self-merge is safe, replaces existing values without
moving keys, appends new keys in source order, returns `void`, and uses the same
alias-versus-fresh split.
Unqualified local-UDF results that retain one concrete supported scalar map
template share those ten helpers through `$call_result`; parameter
passthrough, block aliases, nested calls, same-template control flow,
constructed/copied results, and named/reordered arguments preserve per-call
key/value metadata and copy independence. Imported pure-function results with
one concrete supported scalar map template share the same helpers across
alias-qualified, block-return, nested-function, same-template control-flow,
constructed-result, scalar-template-interleaving, same-library dual-alias, and
independent-copy paths. Local and imported user-method results retain their
receiver-style and qualified/direct-constructor coverage. Unknown/`na`,
scalar, array, matrix, wrong-template/key/value/source, broader-helper, map
mutation outside terminal `.put(...)`/`.clear()`/`.remove(...)`/`.put_all(...)`, array mutation outside the admitted derived-
array set, and terminal-read continuation cases remain gated. Direct map
mutation inside UDFs remains rejected.
Local-UDF scalar UDT results may also use existing pure user methods when they
carry a concrete local or imported scalar-tree identity. Array result paths
allow `.copy()` and `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, plus numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-
string `.sort_indices(order?)`, to yield another
array receiver; map result paths allow only `.copy()` to yield another same-
family collection receiver;
matrix results allow `.copy()`, `.submatrix(...)`, or `.transpose()` to
continue the matrix chain.
Scalar and concrete same-identity scalar-tree UDT array results additionally
expose terminal `.join(separator?)`. The other readers are terminal or transition to the closed array-result path
and cannot continue into user methods or unrelated call-result methods.
Built-in-qualified/template receivers outside the exact
`array.*` producer allowlist, the exact seven fixed cross-namespace producers,
the result-type-checked namespace `matrix.mult` paths, the unqualified local-UDF
matrix path, and the exact namespace
`matrix.copy`/`matrix.transpose`/`matrix.submatrix`/`matrix.kron`/
`matrix.diff`/`matrix.pow`/`matrix.inv`/`matrix.pinv`/
`matrix.eigenvectors` paths remain rejected. So do
non-array/non-matrix/non-UDT results, unknown/`na` results without a concrete
supported type or identity, mixed or non-scalar UDT-array identities, other
array or matrix helpers, and call-result
mutation.

## Built-In Runtime Contract

Built-in compatibility is claimed one fixture-backed subset at a time. The
current timeframe metadata subset exposes `timeframe.period` and
`timeframe.main_period` as the runtime's single chart timeframe string. Main
timeframe declaration overrides and requested-context differences are not
claimed until a separate fixture-backed slice designs that context model.
The legacy Pine v4 request path has one narrower scoped exception: a
`security` call directly in an inlined UDF body may rebuild a graph of scalar
parameters and normal immutable scalar locals in the requested runtime. A
prior three-positional-argument legacy request may be one dependency only when
its symbol, timeframe, gaps, and lookahead match the enclosing request.
Different selectors, control-flow-local calls, reassignment, persistence,
recursion, and modern `request.security` local aliases remain rejected.
`runtime.error(message)` is a fixture-backed internal execution outcome: it
accepts string-compatible messages, may be called through a user-defined
function or named argument, and stops at the first reached call with the exact
message. Typed `na` is normalized to `NaN`; non-string messages and uses of the
`void` result are rejected. It does not require a host log or output contract.
Input rows in `tests/fixtures/conformance.tsv` include two separate claims:
the executable Pine `defval`/metadata subset covered by runtime fixtures, and
the host override subset covered by Rust runtime, CLI, Python, and WASM entry
point tests. Host overrides are keyed by analysis `inputs[].callSiteId` and are
limited to scalar/string-like `input.*` calls; host-side `input.source`
overrides remain outside the supported contract.
Typed variable declarations are partial: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`,
`color`, `chart.point`, and drawing-id `label`, `line`, `linefill`, `box`,
`table`, and `polyline` declarations, plus scalar `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`, and
object-id `array<label>`, `array<line>`, `array<linefill>`,
`array<polyline>`, `array<box>`, `array<table>`, `array<chart.point>`, and
same-local scalar-tree UDT `array<T>` declarations and same-imported
scalar-tree UDT `array<lib.Type>` declarations, are fixture-backed with
compatible or `na` initializers and later compatible reassignment. The
equivalent `type[]` aliases are fixture-backed for the same supported array
element types, including `var` declarations, the scalar and `chart.point`
typed-array `varip` subset, explicitly typed same-local scalar-tree UDT
`varip` declarations initialized from `na`, same-UDT constructors,
same-identity aliases, or fixture-backed same-UDT ternary/switch/if/for/for...in/while expressions,
direct-alias-inferred same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT `varip`, scalar map `varip`,
same-local and same-imported scalar-tree UDT array `varip`, and `matrix<float>`,
`matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, or `matrix<color>`
declarations initialized from compatible matrix values or `na`. Bare `array`,
non-scalar UDT arrays, nested-field UDT `varip`, template-less bare map
declarations, matrix
declarations beyond float/int/bool/string/color, and other typed declarations remain unsupported
unless a narrower feature row explicitly backs them with fixtures;
direct sema fixtures keep bare array declarations, including `var`, `na`, and
initializer-inferred forms, non-scalar UDT array template and alias
declarations, mismatched UDT array declarations, non-constructor-inferred UDT
`varip`, nested-field UDT `varip`, non-scalar UDT array `varip`,
non-scalar imported UDT array `varip`,
unsupported map/matrix array element templates, nested array element templates,
tuple array element templates, strategy-like record array element templates,
plus template-less bare map, bare matrix, and cross-element matrix typed declaration boundaries
rejected, and the imported-source compatibility
fixtures keep non-scalar `array<lib.Wrapper>` and `lib.Wrapper[]` declarations
rejected. Parser-level syntax fixtures keep deeply dotted `array.new<...>()`
templates rejected, while same-local scalar-tree UDT `array.new<T>()` and
same-imported scalar-tree UDT `array.new<lib.Type>()` expressions are
fixture-backed outside typed declaration syntax.

Direct method reads on an `array.*` built-in producer are a closed,
fixture-backed exception to the general built-in call-result parser boundary.
The exact admitted producer set is `array.new_float`, `array.new_int`,
`array.new_bool`, `array.new_string`, `array.new_color`, `array.new_line`,
`array.new_linefill`, `array.new_polyline`, `array.new_label`, `array.new_box`,
`array.new_table`, `array.new<chart.point>`, supported `array.new<UDT>`,
`array.from`, `array.copy`, `array.slice`, `array.concat`, `array.abs`,
`array.standardize`, and `array.sort_indices`. Existing supported
`array.new<T>` source templates for
scalar, drawing-id, `chart.point`, and concrete same-local or same-imported
scalar-tree UDT element types enter through the corresponding canonical
constructor or checked UDT-template path. Only `.size()`, `.get(index)`,
`.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, `.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, and
`.lastindexof(value)`, plus bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()` and numeric-only `.binary_search(value)` and
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)` or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)`, scalar/same-identity scalar-tree UDT `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)`, may follow one of those producer calls;
the parser uses the impossible synthetic prefix `$builtin_array_result` and
semantic analysis rechecks the receiver type, producer arguments, and concrete
UDT identity before lowering. Only `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()` and
`.standardize()`, and sortable-scalar or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` may continue
with another allowed array chain; the twenty-nine terminal value results and
the eight `void` mutations cannot continue
into a user method or any other call-result method, including a scalar UDT
element method.
`.concat(id2)` is the sole admitted mutating array-returning continuation. It
requires a same-kind or exact-identity source, appends into and returns the
receiver id, and may continue through the closed helper path. Alias/live-slice
writes reach shared parent backing, fresh snapshots remain independent, and
ordinary upstream-`na`, capacity, arity, and UDF-side-effect behavior applies.
`.includes(value)` reuses the ordinary element-kind and same-identity UDT
argument checks and equality rules, returns `series bool`, is false for an
empty concrete array, propagates an upstream `na` array, performs no mutation,
and creates no continuation prefix.
`.every()` accepts concrete bool, int, or float array results and returns fixed
`series bool` without mutating the source. It is true only when every element
is truthy: nonzero numerics and `true` pass, while zero, `false`, and element
`na` fail. Empty arrays return true and an upstream `na` array propagates.
String/color/object/chart-point/UDT results and extra arguments remain rejected;
the scalar result is terminal and creates no continuation prefix.
`.some()` uses the same concrete bool/int/float gate and fixed `series bool`
result, but returns true when at least one nonzero numeric or `true` element
exists. Zero, `false`, and element `na` do not satisfy it; empty arrays return
false and an upstream `na` array propagates. It leaves the source unchanged,
rejects the same string/color/object/chart-point/UDT and extra-arity cases, and
is terminal without a continuation prefix.
`.indexof(value)` reuses the same validation and equality rules, returns the
first zero-based match as `simple int`, returns `-1` for missing or empty
concrete arrays and for an upstream `na` array, performs no mutation, and
creates no continuation prefix.
`.lastindexof(value)` reuses the same validation and equality rules, returns
the last zero-based match as `simple int`, returns `-1` for missing or empty
concrete arrays and for an upstream `na` array, performs no mutation, and
creates no continuation prefix.
`.binary_search(value)` retains the ordinary numeric-array receiver and numeric-
value checks. It expects ascending contents and performs an exact lower-bound
search, returning the leftmost duplicate match as `simple int` or `-1` for
missing, empty, and upstream-`na` arrays. It performs no mutation and creates no
continuation prefix. Nonnumeric, drawing/object, chart-point, and UDT result
arrays remain rejected.
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)` shares the numeric checks and ascending-input
contract. Exact duplicates return their first index; misses return the nearest-
left element index, clamped to `0` below the minimum and the last index above
the maximum. Empty and upstream-`na` arrays return `-1`. The result is `simple
int`, non-mutating, terminal, and creates no continuation prefix.
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)` is the symmetric ceiling search. Exact
duplicates return their last index; misses return the nearest-right element
index, with the same below-min/above-max clamps, empty/upstream-`na` `-1`,
numeric gate, `simple int`, non-mutation, and terminal boundaries.
`.abs()` accepts only concrete numeric array results, returns a fresh same-kind
int or float array, preserves `na` elements, leaves the source unchanged, and
preserves empty-array and upstream-`na` behavior. Its result may continue
through another admitted reader, `.copy()`, `.abs()`, `.standardize()`, or `.sort_indices()`.
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)` return the same series numeric kind as the receiver
element type. They rank non-`na` elements in ascending order for `min` and
descending order for `max`, with a zero-based optional `nth` that defaults to
`0`; dynamic integer ranks are accepted. Empty, all-`na`, and
upstream-`na` arrays, plus `na`, negative, or out-of-range ranks, return `na`.
The scalar result is non-mutating and terminal.
`.sum()` returns the same series numeric kind as the receiver element type,
adds all non-`na` elements, and returns `na` for empty, all-`na`, or upstream-
`na` arrays. It is also non-mutating and terminal.
`.avg()` always returns `series float`, averages the same filtered elements,
and shares the empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, non-mutation, and terminal
boundaries; a non-finite result becomes `na`.
`.range()` returns the receiver element type's series numeric kind and computes
maximum minus minimum over non-`na` elements. Empty, all-`na`, and upstream-
`na` arrays return `na`, as does a non-finite float difference; it is
non-mutating and terminal.
`.median()` sorts the filtered non-`na` elements, selects the middle item for an
odd count, and averages the middle pair for an even count. It preserves the
receiver series numeric kind; integer pair means truncate toward zero. Empty,
all-`na`, upstream-`na`, and non-finite float medians return `na`; the result is
non-mutating and terminal.
`.mode()` sorts the filtered non-`na` elements, returns the most frequent value
in the receiver's series numeric kind, and chooses the smaller value when
frequencies tie. At least one value must repeat; empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`,
and all-unique arrays return `na`. The result is non-mutating and terminal.
`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)` sorts filtered non-`na` elements and
returns the element at `ceil(percentage / 100 * count) - 1`, with `0` selecting
the minimum and `100` the maximum. Positional or named series/simple numeric
percentages are accepted. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, runtime typed-`na`,
negative, and above-100 percentages return `na`; the receiver-derived series
numeric result is non-mutating and terminal.
`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)` sorts the same filtered values
and interpolates at `percentage / 100 * (count - 1)`. It always returns
`series float`, including for integer arrays and single-element inputs.
Positional or named series/simple numeric percentages are accepted. Empty,
all-`na`, upstream-`na`, runtime typed-`na`, out-of-range, and non-finite
interpolation results return `na`; the read is non-mutating and terminal.
`.percentrank(index)` reads the target at the original zero-based array index,
filters `na` values only from the comparison population, and returns
`count(value <= target) / non_na_count * 100` as `series float`. Duplicate
values participate independently. The index may be positional or named but
must remain simple int-compatible. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, target-
`na`, runtime typed-`na`, negative, and out-of-range indexes return `na`; the
read is non-mutating and terminal.
`.covariance(id2, biased?)` requires a same-length runtime numeric second
array, pairs cells by original index, and discards a pair when either side is
`na`. It returns fixed `series float`, using the biased population denominator
by default and the sample denominator when `biased` is `false` or `na`.
The second array and bias may be positional or named. Empty/all-`na`/upstream-
`na` pairs, mismatched lengths, sample populations below two pairs, and non-
finite results return `na`; the read is non-mutating and terminal.
`.standardize()` accepts only concrete numeric array results and returns a
fresh fixed `simple array<float>`, leaving its source unchanged. It computes
the mean and population standard deviation from non-`na` values and preserves
`na` positions when at least one numeric value exists. Zero or non-finite
standard deviation produces `na` at every numeric position, so a constant
source becomes a same-length all-`na` result. Empty and all-`na` sources return
an empty array, while an upstream-`na` source returns `na`. The new array may
continue through the same closed reader, `.copy()`, `.abs()`, and
`.standardize()`/`.sort_indices()` set.
`.variance(biased?)` accepts concrete numeric array results and returns fixed
`series float`. It filters `na` elements, uses the population denominator when
`biased` is omitted or `true`, and uses the sample denominator when `biased`
is `false` or `na`; the argument may be positional or named. A single numeric
value therefore has population variance `0`, while an unbiased population
below two values returns `na`. Empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, insufficient-
sample, and non-finite results return `na`. The read leaves its source
unchanged and is terminal.
`.stdev(biased?)` shares the same concrete numeric receiver, filtered-`na`,
bias, positional/named argument, empty/all-`na`/upstream-`na`, sample-size,
non-finite, non-mutation, and terminal boundaries as `.variance()`. It returns
fixed `series float` equal to the square root of the selected population or
sample variance; one numeric value therefore returns population standard
deviation `0` and unbiased `na`.
`.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` accepts concrete int, float, or string
array results and concrete same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array
results. UDT results require a compile-time root int/float/string field
resolved against the exact call-result identity. It returns a fresh fixed
`simple array<int>` containing stable original indexes. Omitted order is
ascending and explicit `order.descending` reverses the value ordering while
preserving equal-value source order. Existing float-`na` and string-empty
placement is unchanged. Empty input returns an empty index array, upstream
`na` propagates, and the source is never mutated. The result may continue
through the closed int-array helper path, including nested `.sort_indices()`.
Bool/color/object/chart-point receivers, missing/unknown/dynamic or unsupported
UDT fields, unresolved/mixed/non-scalar UDT identities, invalid order or arity,
and direct mutation other than `.concat(id2)`/`.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)` remain rejected.
Unsupported element templates, all other `array.*` members, built-in
namespaces and templates outside the exact cross-namespace producer set below,
and postfix mutation other than `.concat(id2)`/`.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)` remain fail-closed. The
lexical prefix `array` is reserved for this
built-in recognition, so an import or user qualifier named `array` is not a
supported qualified call-result receiver path.

`array.concat(left, right)` remains a mutating producer: it appends into
`left` in place and returns the first array id. A following allowed postfix
helper only reads that returned id (or independently copies it); it does not
make the producer pure, and `array.concat(...).size()` or an equivalent chain
inside a UDF remains rejected by the collection-side-effect rule.
`array.slice(...)` returns its existing live shallow parent window, so a
following read observes that view. `array.slice(...).copy()` instead allocates
an independent array containing the window's current values.
The same rule now applies when `.slice(index_from, index_to)` follows any
concrete array call result: it preserves scalar/object/`chart.point` element
kind or same-local/same-imported UDT identity, remains a bidirectionally live
window, accepts only the ordinary simple-int-compatible bounds, and may
continue through the closed array-result helper set. Invalid bounds and an
upstream `na` receiver retain the ordinary `na` result.
Terminal top-level `.clear()` reuses ordinary array mutation and returns
`void`. Alias-returning concat and local/imported UDF or method results clear
their shared backing array, while nested slices delete their live window from
the parent. Matrix row/column/eigenvalue, map key/value, and array-returning
`matrix.mult` results are fresh snapshots, so clearing them leaves the source
collection unchanged. Empty and upstream-`na` results are no-ops; extra
arguments, continuation, and use inside a UDF remain rejected.
Terminal `.reverse()` has the same alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, empty/
upstream-`na`, zero-explicit-argument, `void`, continuation, and UDF-side-
effect boundaries, while reversing rather than removing the result values.
Terminal `.pop()` removes and returns the final resolved scalar/object/
`chart.point`/UDT element, returns `na` for empty or upstream-`na` results, and
shares the alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, arity, continuation, and UDF gate.
Terminal `.shift()` shares those boundaries while removing and returning the
first resolved element and preserving the order of all remaining elements.
Terminal `.remove(index)` deletes and returns the selected positive or in-range
negative element. It accepts one simple-int-compatible index, returns `na`
without mutation for an explicit `na` index or upstream-`na` result, preserves
ordinary out-of-range runtime errors, and shares the identity, alias/live-
window/fresh-snapshot, continuation, and UDF boundaries.
Terminal `.push(value)` appends one element-compatible value, returns `void`,
and shares the identity, alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, continuation, and
UDF boundaries. Mismatched scalar or UDT values are rejected, upstream-`na`
results remain no-ops after value evaluation, and the 100000-element runtime
limit is unchanged.
Terminal `.unshift(value)` is symmetric: it prepends the compatible value at
the resolved result's start, returns `void`, and shares the same identity,
alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, continuation, upstream-`na`, UDF, and
100000-element boundaries.
Terminal `.insert(index, value)` accepts a simple-int-compatible index and one
compatible value, inserts at a positive, in-range negative, or end position,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. Explicit `na` indexes and upstream-`na`
results are no-ops after value evaluation; ordinary bounds, identity, alias/
live-window/fresh-snapshot, UDF, and parent-capacity behavior is preserved.
Terminal `.set(index, value)` accepts an integer-compatible index and the same
element-compatible value contract, then replaces one positive or in-range
negative slot without changing length. It
returns `void` and cannot continue; explicit `na` indexes and upstream-`na`
results no-op after value evaluation, while empty/out-of-range, identity,
alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, and UDF behavior remains unchanged.
Terminal `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)` validates the same value kind or
concrete UDT identity and optional simple-int-compatible half-open range. It
returns `void` and cannot continue; omitted bounds fill the full result, live
slices write through to parent backing, and fresh map/matrix-derived arrays
remain source-independent. Explicit `na`, negative, reversed, or oversized
bounds, empty arrays, and upstream-`na` receivers no-op after evaluating every
supplied argument, while UDF mutation stays rejected.
Terminal `.sort(order?, sort_field?)` sorts concrete int/float/string results
in place, ascending by default or descending by a supported const order. A
same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT result instead requires a compile-
time root int/float/string `sort_field`, which is lowered against that exact
identity. Alias and nested live-slice results reorder parent backing, while
fresh map/matrix-derived arrays reorder only their snapshots. Empty and
upstream-`na` results remain no-ops after order evaluation; unsupported kinds,
field/order/arity errors, continuation, and UDF mutation remain closed.

One later closed slice admits exactly seven fixed non-`array` namespace
producers on that same `$builtin_array_result` path: `str.split`,
`ta.pivot_point_levels`, `matrix.row`, `matrix.col`,
`matrix.eigenvalues`, `map.keys`, and `map.values`. They share the same forty-four
parser helpers: `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, `.lastindexof(value)`, bool/int/float-only
`.every()`/`.some()`, and numeric-only
`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/
`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)`, all-scalar `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`. Only `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()` and
`.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string `.sort_indices(order?)` may continue
into another allowed array chain; the other
other twenty-nine value results and the eight `void` mutations are terminal.
`str.split` produces
`array<string>` and
`ta.pivot_point_levels` produces `array<float>`. `matrix.row` and `matrix.col`
produce independent element-array snapshots for the existing
`matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and
`matrix<color>` subsets; `matrix.eigenvalues` produces an independent
`array<float>` for its existing supported numeric-matrix subset. `map.keys`
and `map.values` produce independent insertion-order snapshots whose element
kind matches the key or value side of the existing
`map<int|float|bool|string|color, int|float|bool|string|color>` subset.
Direct helpers preserve the producers' existing empty/`na`, negative-index,
bounds-error, and element-kind behavior, and postfix copies remain independent
of the producer snapshot. A following dynamic exception marks
namespace-qualified `matrix.mult(...)` with `$builtin_matrix_result` and then
dispatches by its resolved `MatrixMult` return type. Matrix-by-array,
array-by-matrix, and array-by-array results resolve to `array<float>` and may
use `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, `.lastindexof(value)`, `.every()`, `.some()`, and
`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/
`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.sort_indices(order?)` plus terminal `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`.
Matrix-by-matrix, matrix-by-scalar, and scalar-by-matrix results resolve to
`matrix<float>` and may use `.rows()`, `.columns()`, `.elements_count()`,
`.get(row, column)`, `.copy()`, `.row(index)`, `.col(index)`, and numeric-only
`.eigenvalues()`, `.is_zero()`, `.is_binary()`, `.is_diagonal()`,
`.is_identity()`, `.is_symmetric()`, `.is_antisymmetric()`, and
`.is_stochastic()`, plus numeric-only terminal
`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.min()`/`.max()`/`.mode()`/`.trace()`/`.det()`/`.rank()` and
all-kind terminal `.is_square()`. Int inputs still produce float collection results. Matrix
`.copy()` continues on the matrix-result path;
`.row(index)` and `.col(index)` return fresh element-kind-preserving scalar arrays and switch
to the array-result path; `.eigenvalues()` retains the existing numeric check,
square-matrix runtime boundary, and fresh `array<float>` result before switching
to `.size()`/`.get()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/`.slice(index_from, index_to)`/`.concat(id2)`/`.includes(value)`/
`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`/`.every()`/`.some()`/`.binary_search(value)`/
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.join(separator?)` terminal reads plus transforming `.standardize()` and `.sort_indices(order?)` and terminal `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`, with copy/slice/concat/abs/standardize/sort_indices array continuation and terminal read/search/aggregate/mutation checks. `.is_square()`
returns the ordinary simple bool for every
supported concrete matrix kind and is terminal without a result-prefix
transition. Numeric-only `.is_zero()` retains the ordinary exact-zero,
zero-element, `na`-cell, and upstream-`na` result rules and is likewise
terminal without a prefix transition. Numeric-only `.is_binary()` preserves
the corresponding strict 0-or-1, empty, `na`-cell, and upstream-`na` rules and
is terminal as well. Numeric-only `.is_diagonal()` retains rectangular
support, arbitrary main-diagonal cells, exact-zero off-diagonal cells, empty
true, and upstream-`na` propagation, and is terminal as well. Numeric-only
`.is_identity()` adds square shape, exact-one main diagonal,
exact-zero off-diagonal cells, false for every `na` cell, empty true, and
upstream-`na` propagation, and is terminal. Numeric-only `.is_symmetric()`
requires square shape and exact transposed-pair
equality, returns false for every `na`, true for empty 0×0, propagates upstream
`na`, and is terminal. Numeric-only `.is_antisymmetric()` requires square
shape, an exact-zero main diagonal, and exact negation across transposed pairs,
returns false for every `na`, true for empty 0×0, propagates upstream `na`, and
is terminal. Numeric-only `.is_stochastic()` requires a non-empty matrix of
finite non-negative values and accepts either exact unit row sums or exact unit
column sums; empty matrices and invalid or negative cells are false, upstream
`na` propagates, and the reader is terminal. Numeric-only `.sum()` returns a
fixed `series float`, ignores `na` cells, returns `na` for empty, all-`na`, or
non-finite results, propagates upstream `na`, and is terminal. Numeric-only
`.avg()` shares the fixed `series float` terminal contract,
averages only non-`na` numeric cells, and returns `na` for empty, all-`na`,
non-finite, or upstream-`na` results.
Numeric-only `.min()` shares the fixed `series float` terminal contract, scans
only non-`na` numeric cells, and returns `na` for empty, all-`na`, non-finite,
or upstream-`na` results.
Numeric-only `.max()` mirrors `.min()` with the selected maximum and otherwise
retains the same fixed `series float`, `na`, non-finite, upstream-`na`, and
terminal rules.
Numeric-only `.mode()` returns a fixed `series float`, ignores `na` cells,
selects the smallest value among equally frequent repeats, and returns `na`
for empty, all-`na`, no-repeat, selected non-finite, or upstream-`na` results;
it is terminal.
Numeric-only `.trace()` returns a fixed `series float`, sums non-`na` main-
diagonal cells over `min(rows, columns)`, and returns `na` for an empty/all-
`na` diagonal, non-finite sum, or upstream-`na` result; it is terminal.
Numeric-only `.det()` returns a fixed `series float`, retains the runtime
square-matrix error, returns `1.0` for `0 x 0`, zero for singular matrices, and
`na` for invalid cells, non-finite results, or upstream `na`; it is terminal
and adds no static shape inference.
Numeric-only `.rank()` returns a fixed `series int`, supports rectangular and
singular matrices, returns `0` for zero-element matrices, and returns `na` for
invalid/non-finite cells or upstream `na`; it is terminal.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.set(row, column, value)`. It retains the ordinary simple-int row/column and
element-kind-compatible value checks, mutates alias-returning local UDF or user
method results in place, mutates only the independent result for fresh
namespace, bound-transform, imported-function, or imported-method producers,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. An upstream-`na` result evaluates the
value and no-ops; bounds errors and UDF side-effect rejection are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal `.fill(value)`. It
validates the receiver's float/int/bool/string/color element kind, replaces
every cell, mutates local UDF/user-method aliases in place, and confines fresh
namespace, bound-transform, imported-function, or imported-method writes to
the transient result. It returns `void` and cannot continue; empty and
upstream-`na` no-op behavior, value evaluation, invalid type/arity, and UDF
side-effect rejection are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal `.reverse()`. It
reverses the row-major cell sequence without changing shape, mutates local
UDF/user-method aliases in place, and confines fresh namespace, bound-
transform, imported-function, or imported-method writes to the transient
result. It returns `void` and cannot continue; empty/upstream-`na`, invalid
arity, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.reshape(rows, columns)`. It preserves row-major cells, validates simple-int
non-negative dimensions with an unchanged element count, mutates local UDF/
user-method alias shape in place, and confines fresh producer shape changes to
the transient result. It returns `void` and cannot continue; upstream-`na`
dimension evaluation, negative/`na` dimensions, count mismatch, invalid arity/
type, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.swap_rows(row1, row2)`. It preserves shape and concrete element kind,
validates two simple-int row indexes, swaps the selected rows in place, mutates
local UDF/user-method aliases, and isolates fresh producer writes. It returns
`void` and cannot continue; same-index no-op, bounds/`na` index errors,
upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid type/arity, and UDF side-effect
behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.swap_columns(column1, column2)`. It preserves shape and concrete element
kind, validates two simple-int column indexes, swaps the selected columns in
place, mutates local UDF/user-method aliases, and isolates fresh producer
writes. It returns `void` and cannot continue; same-index no-op, bounds/`na`
index errors, upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid type/arity, and UDF
side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal `.remove_row(row)`. It
validates one simple-int row index and removes the selected complete row,
including from a zero-column matrix, while preserving column count and
concrete element kind. It mutates local UDF/user-method aliases and isolates
fresh producer shape changes. It returns `void` and cannot continue; bounds/
`na` index errors, upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid type/arity, and
UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal `.remove_col(column)`.
It validates one simple-int column index and removes the selected complete
column, including from a zero-row matrix, while preserving row count and
concrete element kind. It mutates local UDF/user-method aliases and isolates
fresh producer shape changes. It returns `void` and cannot continue; bounds/
`na` index errors, upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid type/arity, and
UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.add_row(row, array_id)`. It validates a simple-int insertion index and an
element-kind-matched array, copies the array into a complete new row—including
for a zero-column matrix—while preserving column count and concrete element
kind. It mutates local UDF/user-method aliases and isolates fresh producer
shape changes. It returns `void` and cannot continue; `0..=rows` bounds/`na`
index errors, array-size and cell-budget errors, upstream-`na` evaluation,
invalid type/arity, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete matrix call result also admits terminal
`.add_col(column, array_id)`. It validates a simple-int insertion index and an
element-kind-matched array, copies the array into a complete new column—
including for a zero-row matrix—while preserving row count and concrete
element kind. It mutates local UDF/user-method aliases and isolates fresh
producer shape changes. It returns `void` and cannot continue; `0..=columns`
bounds/`na` index errors, array-size and cell-budget errors, upstream-`na`
evaluation, invalid type/arity, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
Every concrete numeric matrix call result also admits terminal
`.sort(column?, order?)`. It defaults to column 0 and ascending order, reorders
complete rows while preserving shape and element kind, keeps equal-key rows
stable, and places `na` last ascending and first descending. Local UDF/user-
method aliases mutate while fresh producers remain isolated. It returns `void`
and cannot continue; column bounds/`na`, unsupported-order, upstream-`na`,
invalid type/arity, non-numeric receiver, and UDF side-effect behavior retain
ordinary `matrix.sort` boundaries.
Matrix-valued `.transpose()` accepts all supported matrix element kinds,
returns an independent matrix with swapped row/column counts, propagates
upstream `na`, and retains the matrix-result prefix for `.copy()`, repeated
`.transpose()`, or any supported matrix reader.
Matrix-valued `.submatrix(...)` accepts those element kinds, returns an
independent optional/default half-open range, preserves empty row/column
shapes, propagates upstream `na`, and retains the same result prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.inv()` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, preserves square shape for invertible inputs, returns empty
`0 x 0`, yields `na` for singular, invalid-cell, non-finite, or upstream-`na`
inputs, and retains the same prefix. Non-square inputs retain the ordinary
runtime shape error.
Numeric matrix-valued `.pinv()` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, swaps rectangular row/column counts, preserves singular
matrix-valued results and swapped zero-cell shapes, yields `na` for invalid-
cell, non-finite, or upstream-`na` inputs, and retains the same prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.eigenvectors()` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, preserves square shape for a complete real eigenvector basis,
returns empty `0 x 0`, retains the runtime non-square error, yields `na` for
invalid-cell, non-finite, non-real, incomplete, or upstream-`na` results, and
retains the same prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.pow(power)` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>`, retains the simple-int argument gate and runtime square-matrix
boundary, supports identity/copy/positive powers and empty `0 x 0`, preserves
`na` cells for positive powers, retains negative and `na` power errors, and
keeps the same prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.kron(other)` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>` after the numeric-matrix operand check, multiplies both source
row and column dimensions, preserves `na` cells and zero dimensions, propagates
upstream `na`, retains the matrix cell-budget error, and keeps the same prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.diff(other)` always returns an independent fixed
`matrix<float>` after the numeric-matrix-or-scalar operand check, preserves the
receiver shape and left-to-right subtraction, propagates `na` cells, `na`
scalars, and upstream `na`, preserves zero dimensions, retains the matching-
shape runtime error for matrix operands, and keeps the same prefix.
Numeric matrix-valued `.mult(other)` retains the numeric matrix/scalar/array
operand gate and resolves each overload before continuing. Matrix operands
return an independent `matrix<float>` with receiver rows and operand columns,
scalar operands return an independent receiver-shaped `matrix<float>`, and
numeric-array operands return an independent `array<float>` with one value per
receiver row. The resolved result selects the closed matrix or array helper
set. Multiplication order, `na` propagation, zero inner dimensions, matrix
cell limits, matrix dimension checks, and vector-length checks are unchanged.
Other terminal readers, invalid arity or argument types, wrong-result helpers,
broader postfix helpers, and mutation other than `.set(...)`/`.fill(...)`/`.reverse()`/`.reshape(...)`/`.add_row(...)`/`.add_col(...)`/`.sort(...)`/`.swap_rows(...)`/`.swap_columns(...)`/`.remove_row(...)`/`.remove_col(...)` fail closed.
Exact namespace `matrix.copy(values)` results also
use `$builtin_matrix_result`, preserve the source's float/int/bool/string/color
matrix kind through `SameAsArg`, and admit the same forty-four matrix helpers subject
to the numeric eigenvalue, value-predicate, and aggregate checks, with the same
matrix-copy/array-result and terminal-scalar-reader continuation rules. Exact namespace
`matrix.transpose(values)`
shares that contract, preserves the source's float/int/bool/string/color matrix
kind through `SameAsArg`, swaps row and column counts, and returns independent
storage. Exact namespace `matrix.submatrix(values, ...)` likewise preserves the
source kind through `SameAsArg`, returns an independent half-open range with
default full bounds and empty row/column slices, and shares the seven all-kind
helpers plus `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results. Exact namespace `matrix.kron(left, right)` returns a fixed
`matrix<float>` result for float/int numeric inputs, expands both dimensions,
preserves `na` and zero-dimension behavior, and admits only that same helper
set. Exact namespace `matrix.diff(left, right)` returns fixed `matrix<float>`
results for matrix-matrix, matrix-scalar, and scalar-matrix numeric operands,
preserving the selected matrix shape and operand direction, and admits the
same fourteen helpers. Exact namespace `matrix.pow(values, power)` returns a
fixed square `matrix<float>` for numeric matrices and simple-int powers,
preserves identity/copy/positive-power semantics, and admits those fourteen
helpers. Exact namespace `matrix.inv(values)` returns an independent square
`matrix<float>` for invertible numeric matrices, an empty `0 x 0` matrix for
empty input, and `na` for singular or invalid-cell inputs, while admitting the
same fourteen helpers. Exact namespace `matrix.pinv(values)` returns an
independent fixed `matrix<float>` pseudo-inverse for numeric matrices, swaps
rectangular row/column counts, preserves singular matrix-valued results,
returns swapped zero-cell shapes, and yields `na` for invalid-cell inputs,
while admitting the same fourteen helpers. Exact namespace
`matrix.eigenvectors(values)` returns an independent square `matrix<float>`
whose columns are real eigenvectors for numeric square matrices, returns an
empty `0 x 0` matrix for empty input, and yields `na` for invalid-cell,
non-real, or incomplete results, while admitting the same fourteen helpers.
The five exact `matrix.new<float|int|bool|string|color>` templates enter the
same path, preserve their element kind, requested shape, initial/default-`na`
cells, fresh allocation, and copy independence. All five kinds admit the same
seven helpers, while numeric templates additionally admit `.inv()` and
`.pinv()`. Invalid
constructor arguments retain their existing diagnostics.
Exact scalar `map.new<K,V>` templates enter `$builtin_map_result`, preserve the
known key/value kinds and fresh-empty allocation, and admit only direct
`.size()`, `.get(key)`, `.contains(key)`, and `.copy()` with copy-only
continuation. Direct mutation, `keys()`/`values()`, and unsupported templates
remain gated. Exact namespace `map.copy(existing)` results enter the same path,
retain the source template and entries in an independent backing store, and
admit the same helpers and copy-only continuation. Non-map inputs and direct
mutation or `keys()`/`values()` remain gated.
The existing bound-receiver
`matrix_id.mult(array).size()` path is unchanged, while direct helpers on bound
matrix-returning `matrix_id.copy()` results now admit
`.rows()`/`.columns()`/`.elements_count()`/`.get(row, column)`/`.copy()`/
`.submatrix(...)`/`.transpose()`, plus numeric `.diff(other)`/`.eigenvectors()`/
`.inv()`/`.kron(other)`/`.mult(other)`/`.pinv()`/`.pow(power)`, with
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation
when `matrix_id` has a
concrete supported matrix kind.
Bound `matrix_id.transpose()` results admit the same helpers, preserve element
kind, swap row/column shape, and return independent storage. Direct helpers on
bound `matrix_id.submatrix(...)` results admit the same helpers, preserve
element kind, select independent half-open ranges with default/empty ranges,
and keep copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation. Direct helpers on bound
numeric `matrix_id.kron(other)` results admit the same helpers, expand both
dimensions, resolve to independent `matrix<float>` storage, and keep
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation. Direct helpers on bound matrix-valued
`matrix_id.mult(other)` results admit the same helpers for matrix or scalar
operands, preserve multiplied or scalar-selected shape, and resolve to
independent `matrix<float>` storage; its array-result overloads retain array-
helper dispatch. Numeric `matrix_id.diff(other)`, `matrix_id.pow(...)`,
`matrix_id.inv()`, `matrix_id.pinv()`, and `matrix_id.eigenvectors()` results
likewise admit the closed matrix helper set at their established result
boundaries. Unqualified local-UDF results with a concrete supported matrix kind
also admit that set with copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation and call-specific result kinds.
Local and imported user-method results with a concrete supported matrix kind
also admit that set across receiver-style, qualified, constructor-receiver,
block/nested/control-flow, and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-continuation paths. Remaining
unregistered or unresolved user-function and unresolved/non-matrix method
results,
unsupported `map.new` and `matrix.new` templates, any other namespace
or non-producer member,
and postfix mutation other than `.concat(id2)`/`.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)` also stay outside this set. The built-in lexical prefixes
`str`, `ta`, `matrix`, and `map` stay reserved for this recognition and cannot
be hijacked by same-named user/import qualifiers. This slice adds no UDT or
imported-type identity flow and does not change the public runtime, analysis,
or matrix JSON schemas.

`max_bars_back` is partial. Declaration-level
`indicator(..., max_bars_back=N)` and `strategy(..., max_bars_back=N)` apply a
global constant non-negative retention bound for dynamic history reads,
including supported constant integer expressions, pure UDF-returned constant
length values, prior named const int alias-chain values, and nested known
results from the exact `int`, `float`, `math.min`, `math.max`, `math.abs`,
`math.floor`, `math.ceil`, and `math.trunc` scalar-call whitelist.
Statement-form
`max_bars_back(source, N)` helper calls are fixture-backed at top level and in
the supported block, `for`/`for...in`/`while` statement-body, switch,
block-expression, call-argument block, collection mutation argument block,
block-result nested expression, and loop-expression result contexts for
built-in, derived, or alias-chain declared simple series numeric identifiers plus direct series
numeric expressions, with stable pure unary/binary/ternary expression identity
reused for matching history reads, including builtin qualified constants/simple
metadata, bar/session flags, direct-constructor local or imported scalar-tree UDT scalar field expressions including nested field paths, positional, fixed-arity named, and signature-bound
fully named or mixed variadic stateless pure math calls, fixed-arity pure `nz`
source-helper calls including named/reordered `replacement`, pure numeric cast
calls, unreassigned pure scalar series declaration aliases, and expression-body
or pure expression-statement-prefixed normal typed or untyped local-alias block-body parameterized pure UDF calls, including nested pure UDF calls and direct-constructor local or imported scalar-tree UDT-argument scalar-field pure UDF calls including named/reordered UDF arguments, direct-constructor UDT argument expressions, nested scalar field paths, and nested pure UDF passthrough over those paths including named/reordered arguments and direct-constructor UDT argument expressions, plus receiver-unused parameterized pure user method calls, direct-constructor local or imported scalar-tree receiver scalar-field pure user method calls through direct reads or block-local receiver aliases or nested field aliases including nested scalar field paths, alias-qualified imported method calls with bound or direct-constructor receiver expressions and scalar-tree UDT argument field paths including named/reordered method arguments and nested method passthrough over those paths including named/reordered arguments and direct-constructor UDT argument expressions, and direct-constructor local or imported scalar-tree UDT-argument scalar-field pure user method calls including local named/reordered method arguments, direct-constructor UDT argument expressions, nested scalar field paths, and nested pure user method passthrough over those paths including named/reordered arguments and direct-constructor UDT argument expressions. Helper calls accept positional or named arguments,
including reordered `source`/`num` arguments, support the same constant length
subset, apply per-series retention bounds, merge repeated calls by the largest
declared bound, and report effective-window runtime/profile misses for dynamic
offsets beyond the retained bound. Non-series or non-numeric sources,
non-constant lengths, negative lengths, oversized lengths, and
declaration-value calls are rejected.

Series history offsets are partial. Dynamic integer offsets are evaluated at
runtime with full-history retention up to the runtime cap, and returned `na`
offsets evaluate the source expression on the current bar before returning `na`,
including stateful built-in source callsites. Constant non-negative offsets may
also use nested or cast-wrapped known results from the exact scalar-call
whitelist above. Negative values produced by those calls are rejected with the
same `negative_history_offset` boundary as literal and named-const negatives;
runtime-pure calls outside the whitelist remain dynamic/unknown rather than
being folded implicitly.
Fixture-backed sources include direct expressions, branches, `for`/`for...in`/
`while` loops, switch arms, UDF parameters, UDF-returned offsets and series
values, method-returned offsets and series values, and supported built-in
returned offsets.

## Strategy Runtime Contract

Phase G marks `strategy` as partial. The executable subset accepts
`strategy(title, shorttitle, overlay, max_bars_back, initial_capital, currency,
default_qty_type, default_qty_value, commission_type, commission_value,
slippage, backtest_fill_limits_assumption, margin_long, margin_short,
pyramiding, close_entries_rule, named max_labels_count, named max_boxes_count, named max_lines_count, named max_polylines_count)` where
`initial_capital` must be a positive const numeric value when provided. Phase L
accepts `default_qty_type=strategy.fixed` with positive const numeric
`default_qty_value`; Strategy Internal Stage 12 accepts
`default_qty_type=strategy.cash` with positive const numeric
`default_qty_value`, resolving omitted entry `qty` at placement time as cash
divided by current close under the current no-currency-conversion boundary;
`currency=currency.NONE` is accepted as the explicit form of that default
no-conversion account-currency path;
Stage 7 Slice 31 accepts `default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity` with
positive const numeric `default_qty_value`, resolving omitted entry `qty` at
placement time from the current supported equity and current close.
`strategy.default_entry_qty(fill_price)` exposes these fixed, cash, and
percent-of-equity calculations as a read-only strategy-mode series float
without placing an order or adding position-reversal quantity. It supports
direct, named, UDF, and history reads. Cash and percent modes return `na` for a
non-positive or non-finite price, and percent sizing does the same for
non-positive or non-finite supported equity. Indicator use, requested-context
use, currency conversion, symbol point value, precision, and lot-step handling
remain unsupported, and no public schema field is added. Margin
parameters currently support
declaration/IR storage, long-only `strategy.opentrades.capital_held`, and
long-entry affordability checks for the supported entry subset when explicit
active `margin_long` is configured. They also enable the first long-only forced
liquidation subset using `bar.low`, the documented available-funds algorithm,
and whole-unit truncation. Explicit active `margin_short` drives short
`strategy.opentrades.capital_held` and supported short-entry affordability
checks at the actual fill price. Short forced liquidation uses `bar.high` and
whole-unit truncation. `strategy.margin_liquidation_price` exposes the current
long or short margin boundary price for the active direction. They do not
enable margin-specific public schema expansion or symbol tick rounding for the
liquidation price. Stage 13 Slice 10
accepts positive integer
const `pyramiding` values for same-direction long `strategy.entry()` market
entries, with the default staying at `1`. Stage 14c accepts market
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short)` while flat or already short. Stage 14e
reverses an opposite market entry by flattening at the reverse fill price then
opening the requested quantity. Stage 14j accepts
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, limit=price)` while flat or already short
and fills on a later historical bar when `high >= limit` or above the
configured verified limit threshold. Stage 14k accepts
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, stop=price)` while flat or already short
and fills on a later historical bar when `low <= stop`. Stage 14l accepts
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, stop=price, limit=price)` while flat or
already short, activates on a later historical bar when `low <= stop`, and
fills at the limit price on a subsequent historical bar when `high >= limit`
or above the configured verified limit threshold. Stage 14f covers matching short entries with single-trigger
`strategy.exit` `stop`/`limit`. Stage 14g adds short `profit`/`loss` ticks.
Stage 14h adds short `stop+limit`, `stop+profit`, `loss+limit`, and
`loss+profit` brackets. Stage 14i adds short `trail_price`/`trail_points`
trailing covers.
`strategy(...,
close_entries_rule="FIFO")` and `strategy(..., close_entries_rule="ANY")` are
accepted close-entry allocation settings, stored in strategy settings, and
fixture-backed for current FIFO close/exit allocation plus id-specific long and
short `"ANY"` `strategy.close(id)` and `strategy.exit(..., from_entry=id)`
allocation, including same-entry-id partial exit allocation in stable ledger
order.
Omitted-`from_entry` exits and `strategy.close_all()` stay on the FIFO path.
Fixture-backed market-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=...)`, or omitted-qty long orders using
the configured default quantity, add to existing long exposure without consuming
the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit. Fixture-backed limit-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., limit=price)` uses the supported
long limit timing model while also bypassing that limit, and omitted long `qty`
uses the configured default quantity at placement time. Fixture-backed limit-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., limit=price)` uses the supported
short limit timing model while also bypassing that limit and applies signed
netting after later-bar trigger selection.
Fixture-backed stop-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., stop=price)` uses the supported
short stop timing model while also bypassing that limit, opens or increases
short exposure while flat or already short, and applies signed netting after
stop trigger selection.
Fixture-backed stop-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., stop=price)` uses the supported long
stop timing model while also bypassing that limit, and omitted long `qty` uses
the configured default quantity at placement time. Fixture-backed
stop-limit-long
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=..., stop=stop_price, limit=limit_price)`
uses the supported long stop-limit activation/fill timing model while also
bypassing that limit, and omitted long `qty` uses the configured default
quantity at placement time. Fixture-backed stop-limit-short
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=..., stop=stop_price, limit=limit_price)`
uses the supported short stop-limit activation/fill timing model while also
bypassing that limit, opens or increases short exposure while flat or already
short, and applies signed netting after stop activation and a later limit fill.
Market
`strategy.order(id, strategy.long, qty=...)` and
`strategy.order(id, strategy.short, qty=...)` apply signed netting independent
of the `strategy.entry()` pyramiding limit: filled signed quantity `D` against
position `P` yields target `P+D`, closing `min(|P|,|D|)` when opposite, opening
any remainder on the order side, recording one public order fill of `|D|`, and
rejecting the whole fill when the open remainder fails margin affordability.
Omitted market `strategy.short` `qty` uses the configured default quantity at
placement time, matching omitted-qty long `strategy.order`.
Limit generic orders reuse that signed netting after limit trigger selection
and fill-price verification. Stop and stop-limit generic orders reuse that
signed netting after trigger selection or activation plus later limit fill.
Price-based `strategy.entry()` limit, stop, and stop-limit reversals flatten
opposite exposure then open the requested quantity; pyramiding applies to the
new side, not the flatten quantity. Same-id generic-order replacement updates
pending market, limit, stop, and stop-limit `strategy.order` intents of the
same direction; opposite-direction same-id replacement cancels the old intent
then places the new one. `strategy.cancel(id)` clears matching pending generic
orders, pending exits, deferred relative exits, and pending closes, including
when those families share a public id. Generic-order reductions allocate FIFO, or
id-specific ANY when `close_entries_rule` is ANY and the order id matches an
open entry; unmatched ANY stays FIFO. Const/simple `oca_name` with explicit
`strategy.oca.none` keeps grouped `strategy.entry` and `strategy.order`
intents independent. `strategy.oca.cancel` cancels still-pending same-group
entry and generic-order peers after a fill, in internal creation order, and
leaves unrelated groups in place. `strategy.oca.reduce` reduces same-group
peer remaining quantity by the filled quantity and removes peers reduced to
zero, including mixed entry, generic-order, and exit members that share the
same name and reduce type. Const/simple `strategy.exit` `oca_name` maps onto
that implicit reduce reservation model: grouped exits share overlapping
quantity, and a fill reduces same-group peers. Same name with different OCA
types remains two groups. Empty `oca_name` does not join a group.
Omitted `qty` remains unsupported for `strategy.short`.
The supported `strategy.order()` subset accepts `comment`, `alert_message`, and
`disable_alert` metadata; supported long order fills retain entry comments,
short reduction, flatten, and cross-zero fills retain exit comments, and
supported fill payloads are exposed under `strategy.alerts`. Market `strategy.short` entries are
fixture-backed while flat or already short, and market `strategy.entry`
reversals flatten opposite exposure then open the requested quantity. Short
limit, stop, and stop-limit `strategy.entry` fills are fixture-backed while
flat or already short, and reverse opposite longs by flattening then opening
the requested quantity. Long limit, stop, and stop-limit `strategy.entry` fills
reverse opposite shorts the same way. Short limit, stop, and stop-limit
`strategy.order` fills are fixture-backed while flat or already short.
Same-tick price-based entry exceptions beyond the
fixture-backed long subset, and broader multi-entry exit/reporting semantics
remain outside the supported subset unless fixture-backed. Stage 13 Slice 80

subset so the omitted-`from_entry` exit persists for later open long entries
until the position closes. Stage 13 Slice 21 adds fixture-backed omitted-
`from_entry` current unique-entry-id profit-tick all-entry exits. Stage 13 Slice
22 adds the symmetric fixture-backed loss-tick subset for current unique entry

Stage 7 Slice 17 accepts
`commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_contract`, and Stage 7 Slice 18
accepts `commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_order`, both with finite
non-negative const numeric `commission_value`. Stage 7 Slice 21 accepts
`commission_type=strategy.commission.percent` and debits
`qty * fill_price * commission_value / 100` on each supported entry and exit
fill. Stage 7 Slice 19 accepts finite non-negative integer const `slippage`
ticks using the fixed `syminfo.mintick` subset. Stage 7 Slice 20 accepts finite
non-negative integer const
`backtest_fill_limits_assumption` ticks for supported limit-order
verification. Contracts, commission modes outside the three listed above, richer
fill models, currency conversion, symbol precision rounding, and lot-step
constraints remain unsupported. Strategy
mode output includes `orders`, `trades`, `position`, `equity`, and
`diagnostics`. Equity snapshots are emitted once per historical bar with
`barIndex`, `cash`, `marketValue`, `equity`, and `netProfit`, using current
bar-close mark-to-market accounting for the long-only order subset and applying
supported commission debits and slippage-adjusted fill prices when configured.
Supported fixed-tick limit verification can delay supported long limit entry and
limit/profit exit fills while preserving the original limit fill price.
The fixed symbol metadata subset uses a default `NASDAQ:AAPL` chart identity and
now includes `syminfo.main_tickerid` plus `syminfo.mincontract` alongside the
existing ticker, exchange, currency, session, mintick, pointvalue, minmove, and
pricescale fields. Host-configurable symbol metadata remains outside the current
runtime contract.
Currency conversion, symbol precision rounding, lot-step constraints, pyramiding
behavior beyond the fixture-backed long/short multi-entry subset,
`strategy.exit` same-side/3+ trigger/invalid trailing variants, reservation
behavior outside the explicit fixed-`qty` or `qty_percent`
single-trigger/bracket/trailing subset, omitted-quantity multiple
pending exits, `strategy.order` behavior beyond the fixture-backed
market and limit signed-netting, long-market/price-based, and short
stop/stop-limit add-or-increase subset,
series `oca_name`, realtime strategy handoff, and still-unbacked strategy reporting
variables remain outside the supported matrix.

Phase L adds the first read-only strategy state variables for historical
strategy-mode scripts. `strategy.position_size` is a series float that is `0`
when flat, positive when net long, and negative when net short. `strategy.position_avg_price`
is a series float that is `na` when flat and the current average entry price
when a supported net position is open. `strategy.position_entry_name` is a read-only series string that is
`na` while flat and otherwise retains the entry order ID that initially opened
the current continuous net long position. Pyramiding additions and partial
allocation closes preserve it; a flat transition clears it before a later
position establishes a new name. Direct, UDF, and history reads are supported,
while indicator use, requested-context use, and mutation remain rejected, with
no public schema expansion. The `strategy.initial_capital` slice adds a
read-only series float
that returns the configured or default broker starting capital unchanged on
every bar, including ordinary UDF and history reads, without public schema
expansion. The default account-currency slice adds
`strategy.account_currency` as a read-only simple string. Under the current
default `currency.NONE` path it inherits the fixed `syminfo.currency` value
(`"USD"`), supports simple-string consumers plus direct, UDF, and history
reads, and rejects const-string consumers, indicator use, requested-context
use, and mutation. Explicit `strategy(..., currency=currency.NONE)` selects
the same no-conversion path; other currency values, settings overrides, and
cross-currency conversion remain unsupported. The same-currency subset adds
`strategy.convert_to_account(value)` and `strategy.convert_to_symbol(value)` as
strategy-mode series-float identities. They coerce integers to floats, preserve
typed `na`, and support direct, named, UDF, and history calls while rejecting
indicator and requested-context use, with no public schema expansion.
`strategy.openprofit` is unrealized profit for the current long
position marked to the current close and is `0` when flat. `strategy.netprofit`
is cumulative realized closed-trade profit only, excluding any current open
profit. The `strategy.openprofit_percent` slice divides current unrealized
profit by realized equity (`initial_capital + strategy.netprofit`) and
multiplies by 100, returning `na` when that denominator is non-positive or
non-finite. Stage 7 Slice 22 adds `strategy.grossprofit` as cumulative positive
realized closed-trade profit only, excluding losing, flat, and current open
trades. Stage 7 Slice 23 adds `strategy.grossloss` as cumulative realized
closed-trade loss as a positive value, excluding winning, flat, and current
open trades. Stage 7 Slice 32 adds `strategy.netprofit_percent`,
`strategy.grossprofit_percent`, and `strategy.grossloss_percent` by dividing the
corresponding realized amount by `initial_capital` and multiplying by 100.
Stage 7 Slice 34 adds `strategy.buy_and_hold_return_percent` as the current
close's percentage change from the first loaded bar close, returning `na` when
that baseline is zero or non-finite.
Stage 7 Slice 24 adds `strategy.avg_trade` as average realized
profit/loss per closed trade, returning `na` until at least one trade is
closed. Stage 7 Slice 25 adds `strategy.avg_winning_trade` as average realized
profit among winning closed trades only, returning `na` until at least one
winning trade exists. Stage 7 Slice 33 adds `strategy.avg_trade_percent`,
`strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent`, and
`strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent` as averages of per-closed-trade percentage
profit/loss values, using each trade's entry price times quantity as the
denominator and returning `na` until the matching trade set exists.
winning trade is closed. Stage 7 Slice 26 adds `strategy.avg_losing_trade` as
average realized loss among losing closed trades only as a positive value,
returning `na` until at least one losing trade is closed. Stage 7 Slice 27 adds
`strategy.max_drawdown` as the maximum intrabar equity drawdown amount
over the current supported trading interval, using the supported entry equity,
the maximum equity before that entry, and the lowest low reached while the
supported position is open. Stage 7 Slice 28 adds `strategy.max_runup` as the maximum intrabar
equity run-up amount over the current supported long-only trading interval,
using the supported entry equity, the minimum equity before that entry, and the
highest high reached while the supported position is open. Stage 7 Slice 30
adds `strategy.max_runup_percent` and `strategy.max_drawdown_percent` by
dividing the supported run-up or drawdown amount by entry price times current
supported position quantity and multiplying by 100. `strategy.equity` is
cash plus current market value; without configured
commission this is equivalent to `initial_capital + strategy.netprofit +
strategy.openprofit` in the current subset, and with supported commission it
also reflects entry commission debits on open positions.
Supported market `strategy.entry`
calls create an internal pending entry and fill on the next historical bar open.
Supported long limit entries fill at the limit price before script statements
on a later historical bar when the selected open-high-low-close or
open-low-high-close path visits a price at or below the limit. Supported long
stop entries fill at the stop price before script statements on a later
historical bar when that path visits a price at or above the stop. Supported
long stop-limit entries activate before script statements when the path visits
a price at or above the stop; on a high-first bar they may fill at the limit
on the same bar after activation, while short and low-first stop-limit fills
stay fail-closed until a later bar. These variables reflect filled entries
before script statements on the fill bar, not on the creation bar.
When explicit active `margin_long` is configured, these supported long entry
fills are rejected at the actual fill price if simulated equity cannot cover
the required margin. Rejected fills emit a strategy diagnostic, produce no
public order/position/trade event, remove the triggered pending entry, and clear
attached pending exits for that entry id.
Supported same-calculation absolute `strategy.exit` attachment may target an
active pending entry id. The attachment remains internal while the entry is
pending and can fill through the existing `strategy.exit` public order/trade
shape after the matching entry fills. Supported explicit-`from_entry` exit calls
with no matching open entry or active pending entry are no-ops and do not create
exit orders. Entry-relative pending-entry exits using `profit`, `loss`, or
`trail_points` remain unsupported.
Supported `strategy.close` and
`strategy.close_all` calls place market close orders that fill at the next
historical bar open. Script-visible state on the signal bar remains pre-fill;
later statements on that bar still see the open position. Const/simple
`immediately=true` fills at the current bar close after the command, so later
same-bar statements see the fill. They behave like
read-only series floats in supported expression contexts, including branches,
switches, loops, pure UDF arguments, and constant history references. They do
not change the public runtime JSON shape because scripts observe them through
ordinary outputs such as `plot`.

Phase O adds the first narrow strategy reporting count variables for
historical strategy-mode scripts. `strategy.closedtrades` is a read-only
series int count of closed trades recorded by the current broker state.
`strategy.closedtrades.first_index` is a read-only series int for the oldest
retained closed-trade index. It stays `0`, including before the first close,
because the current broker does not trim closed trades; platform order-limit
trimming and a nonzero retained-index offset remain unsupported.
Stage 3 adds `strategy.wintrades`, `strategy.losstrades`, and
`strategy.eventrades` as read-only series int counts of closed trades with
positive, negative, and zero realized profit.
`strategy.opentrades` is a read-only series int count of open trades in the
current side-aware broker. It is `0` when flat, `1` for the default
no-pyramiding behavior, and can rise to the accepted positive `pyramiding`
limit for fixture-backed same-direction market entries. Supported market
`strategy.entry` calls fill on the next historical bar open and update both
counts before script statements on that fill bar. Supported `strategy.close`
and `strategy.close_all` calls update both counts after the next-bar market
close fill, so script reads on the signal bar still see the pre-fill counts.
Pending `strategy.exit` fills are evaluated on the same pre-script historical
path as price-based entries, so script reads see the count changes on the fill
bar. Stage 7 Slice 0 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(trade_num)`,
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_price(trade_num)`,
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index(trade_num)`, and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index(trade_num)` as script-visible
strategy-mode field functions over the current closed-trade list. Stage 7 Slice
1 adds `strategy.closedtrades.size(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.profit(trade_num)` under the same contract. Stage 7
Slice 2 adds `strategy.closedtrades.entry_time(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_time(trade_num)`. Stage 7 Slice 3 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.commission(trade_num)`, returning `0.0` without
configured commission and supported entry-plus-exit commission when configured.
Stage 7 Slice 4 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_id(trade_num)`, returning the retained entry id.
Stage 7 Slice 5 adds `strategy.closedtrades.exit_id(trade_num)`, returning the
retained close or exit id. Stage 7 Slice 6 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_comment(trade_num)` and
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment(trade_num)`, returning stored entry and
exit comments for commented fixture-backed trades without expanding public
runtime JSON. Stage 7 Slice 7 adds
`strategy.opentrades.entry_price(trade_num)`, returning the current supported
long position's entry price for `trade_num == 0`. Stage 7 Slice 8 adds
`strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index(trade_num)`, returning the current
supported long position's entry fill bar for `trade_num == 0`. Stage 7 Slice 9
adds `strategy.opentrades.entry_time(trade_num)`, returning the current
supported long position's entry fill timestamp for `trade_num == 0`. Stage 7
Slice 10 adds `strategy.opentrades.size(trade_num)`, returning the current
supported long position size for `trade_num == 0`. Stage 7 Slice 11 adds
`strategy.opentrades.profit(trade_num)`, returning the current close-based
floating profit for that same supported open position. Stage 7 Slice 12 adds
`strategy.opentrades.entry_id(trade_num)`, returning the retained entry id for
that same supported open position. Stage 7 Slice 13 adds
`strategy.opentrades.commission(trade_num)`, returning `0.0` without configured
commission and the selected open trade's supported entry commission when
configured.
Stage 7 Slice 14
adds `strategy.opentrades.max_runup(trade_num)`, returning the largest
high-based favorable excursion seen so far for the selected open
position. Stage 7 Slice 15 adds
`strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown(trade_num)`, returning the largest low-based
adverse excursion seen so far for the selected open trade. Stage
7 Slice 16 adds `strategy.opentrades.entry_comment(trade_num)`, returning the
stored entry comment for the current commented fixture-backed open trade without
expanding public runtime JSON. Stage 7 Slice 35 adds
`strategy.opentrades.capital_held` as a read-only variable.
The indexed trade-percentage slice adds `profit_percent`,
`max_runup_percent`, and `max_drawdown_percent` to both the
`strategy.closedtrades.*` and `strategy.opentrades.*` families. Each uses the
selected trade's entry price times absolute quantity as denominator, preserves
the existing invalid-index and flat-state `na` behavior, covers fixture-backed
pyramided long trades independently, and adds no public runtime schema fields.
In the no-margin subset it returns `na`; Stage 7 Margin Slice M2 returns
current open long market value times `margin_long / 100` when explicit active
`margin_long` is configured. Strategy Internal Margin Slice M5 adds a
long-only forced-liquidation subset: historical checks use `bar.low` before
script statements, apply the documented available-funds and four-times-cover
algorithm with temporary whole-unit truncation, and emit only existing
order/trade/position/equity output fields. Stage 7 Slice 15 adds
`strategy.closedtrades.max_runup(trade_num)`, returning the
largest high-based favorable excursion retained for the selected closed trade
quantity.
Stage 7 Slice 16 adds `strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown(trade_num)`,
returning the largest low-based adverse excursion retained for the selected
closed trade quantity. The current long-only closed-trade field subset reads
fixture-backed pyramided closed trades by zero-based index. Stage 7 Slice 17 adds cash-per-contract commission accounting for
supported entries and exits without adding public schema fields. Stage 7 Slice
18 adds cash-per-order commission accounting under the same public contract.
Stage 7 Slice 19 adds fixed-tick slippage for supported long entry, close, and
exit fill prices without changing trigger conditions or public schema.
Stage 7 Slice 20 adds fixed-tick limit-order verification for supported long
limit entry and supported long limit/profit exit fills while preserving the
original limit fill price. Stage 7 Slice 21 adds percent commission accounting
for supported entry/exit fills under the same public contract. Stage 7 Slice 22
adds `strategy.grossprofit` as a script-visible read-only series float summing
only positive realized closed-trade profit. Stage 7 Slice 23 adds
`strategy.grossloss` as a script-visible read-only series float summing
realized closed-trade losses as positive values. Stage 7 Slice 24 adds
`strategy.avg_trade` as a script-visible read-only series float for average
realized profit/loss per closed trade. Stage 7 Slice 25 adds
`strategy.avg_winning_trade` as a script-visible read-only series float for
average realized profit among winning closed trades only. Stage 7 Slice 26
adds `strategy.avg_losing_trade` as a script-visible read-only series float for
average realized loss among losing closed trades only as a positive value.
Stage 7 Slice 27 adds `strategy.max_drawdown` as a script-visible read-only
series float for maximum intrabar equity drawdown amount. Stage 7 Slice
28 adds `strategy.max_runup` as a script-visible read-only series float for
maximum intrabar equity run-up amount. Stage 7 Slice 30 adds
`strategy.max_runup_percent` and `strategy.max_drawdown_percent` as
script-visible read-only series floats for the corresponding intrabar
percentage values.
`trade_num` is zero-based and integer-only; no matching trade, a negative
index, an out-of-range index, or a non-integer argument returns `na`. Public
open-trade records, open-trade namespace functions outside `entry_price`,
`entry_comment`, `entry_id`, `entry_bar_index`, `entry_time`, `size`, `profit`,
`profit_percent`, `commission`, `max_runup`, `max_runup_percent`,
`max_drawdown`, and `max_drawdown_percent`, closed-trade namespace functions
outside this subset, rich reporting metrics, and public output schema changes
remain out of scope.

Phase M adds the first executable `strategy.exit` subset:
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, stop=price)` and
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, limit=price)` for full-position exits from the
current one-net-long broker. Accepted exits create or replace one internal
pending exit for the matching entry, do not trigger on the creation or
replacement bar, and fill on a later historical bar when `low <= stop` or
`high >= limit`. The fill uses the configured exit price and is represented by
the existing strategy output fields. No public pending-order, partial-fill, or
exit-reason fields are added.

Phase N adds the first `strategy.exit` tick-distance helpers:
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, profit=ticks)` and
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, loss=ticks)`. The current subset accepts one
trigger family per call. Profit exits convert to a pending limit at
`strategy.position_avg_price + ticks * syminfo.mintick`; loss exits convert to
a pending stop at `strategy.position_avg_price - ticks * syminfo.mintick`.
Ticks must evaluate to a finite positive number, and the implementation uses
the same fixed default `syminfo.mintick` subset as `math.round_to_mintick`.
Converted exits reuse the Phase M pending-exit lifecycle and public strategy
output contract.

Phase R adds the first `strategy.exit` bracket subset. Supported brackets have
exactly one downside leg plus one upside leg for the current side-aware broker:
`stop + limit`, `stop + profit`, `loss + limit`, and `loss + profit`. A bracket
is one broker-owned pending full-position exit. Filling either leg cancels the
other leg, emits exactly one `strategy.exit` order event, and records the closed
trade under the source entry id. If both legs are touched on the same later
eligible historical bar, the downside stop/loss leg fills first. Public runtime
JSON, Python dictionaries, and WASM JSON keep the existing strategy result
shape and runtime `schemaVersion: 3`. Same-side pairs `stop + loss` and
`limit + profit`, 3+ trigger calls, partial exits, and arbitrary future binding
for unmatched `from_entry` ids remain unsupported.

Phase S adds the first `strategy.exit` trailing-stop subset. Supported trailing
forms are exactly `trail_price + trail_offset` and
`trail_points + trail_offset` for the current side-aware broker, with no fixed
`stop`, `limit`, `profit`, or `loss` arguments in the same call. `trail_price`
is the activation price. `trail_points` converts once from the current average
entry price, or from the matched open pyramided entry price when that
fixture-backed `from_entry` subset applies, using the fixed default
`syminfo.mintick`; `trail_offset` converts once to a fixed price distance. A
trailing exit starts inactive, is not
eligible on its creation or replacement bar, activates on a later bar when
`high >= activation`, never fills on the activation bar, then fills on a later
bar when `low <= active_stop` before any same-bar ratchet. When not filled, the
active stop ratchets upward to
`max(active_stop, high - offset_distance)`. The public output stays on the
existing strategy result shape and runtime `schemaVersion: 3`; there are no
public trailing-state, pending-order, or exit-reason fields. Invalid trailing
combinations remain fixture-backed unsupported.

Phase U adds fixed partial quantities to the supported `strategy.exit` trigger
shapes. `qty` is accepted on the single-trigger stop, limit, profit, and loss
forms, on the supported one-downside/one-upside bracket forms, and on the
supported trailing forms. `qty` evaluates once at placement time, must be
finite and positive, and stores an absolute requested close quantity on the
single pending exit. If omitted, the exit keeps the previous full-position
behavior. On fill, the closed quantity is `min(qty, current position size)`:
partial fills emit one existing `strategy.exit` order event and one closed
trade for the filled quantity, leave the remaining long position open at the
same average price, and clear the filled pending exit. Quantities at or above
the current position size close the full position. The public output shape and
runtime `schemaVersion: 3` are unchanged. Phase U did not add `qty_percent`,
multiple pending exits, quantity reservation, or missing-entry pre-placement.

Phase V adds percent partial quantities to the same supported `strategy.exit`
trigger shapes. `qty_percent` evaluates once at placement time, must be finite
and positive, and resolves against the current open position size to an absolute
requested close quantity. Fills use `min(resolved_qty, current position size)`,
so `qty_percent > 100` is allowed but closes no more than the current position.
Partial fills emit the same existing order/trade fields with absolute `qty`,
leave any remaining long position open at the same average price, and do not add
public pending, remaining, percent, or schema fields. Phase W adds the first
multiple-pending reservation subset for explicit fixed `qty` or `qty_percent`
single-trigger exits on the current matching long entry. Phase X extends that
reservation subset to explicit fixed `qty` or `qty_percent` one-downside plus
one-upside bracket exits. Phase Y extends the same reservation model to the
supported trailing forms. Reservations are resolved at placement time, clamped
to currently unreserved position quantity, and same-identity calls replace the
previous reservation. Single-trigger, bracket, and trailing reservations can
share the same pool. Same-side touched exits fill in placement order. If
downside stop/loss/trailing and upside limit/profit candidates are both touched
on one eligible bar, downside candidates fill on that bar in placement order and
opposite-side candidates remain pending if a long position remains. When both
legs of one bracket are touched, that bracket contributes its downside
candidate. Inactive trailing reservations activate on a later eligible bar and
never fill on the activation bar; active trailing reservations fill as downside
candidates before same-bar ratchets and otherwise ratchet upward only. Phase Z
closes the omitted-quantity boundary: omitted `qty` and omitted
`qty_percent` keep full-position one-effective-pending behavior across
supported single-trigger, bracket, and trailing forms, and a later omitted
full-position exit clears earlier explicit reservations for the current
matching long entry. `qty` and `qty_percent` in the same call remain supported
on those same trigger shapes with fixed `qty` determining the reserved or
filled quantity. Stage 9 supports same-calculation active-entry single-trigger
attachment for absolute `stop`, `limit`, and `trail_price` plus entry-relative
`profit`, `loss`, and `trail_points + trail_offset` against a matching active
pending long entry. Same-calculation active-entry `stop + profit`,
`loss + limit`, and `loss + profit` bracket attachment is also fixture-backed;
other active-entry relative bracket forms remain outside the current subset,
while multiple pending exits outside the explicit fixed-`qty` or
`qty_percent` single-trigger/bracket/trailing reservation subset remain
unsupported, including omitted-quantity multiple reservations, reservation
behavior outside that subset, and arbitrary future binding for unmatched
`from_entry` ids. Supported unmatched explicit-`from_entry` exit placements are
no-ops without public exit orders or strategy diagnostics.

## Source Graph Host Contract

Phase J adds a host-neutral source graph scaffold and a narrow executable
import subset. `tests/fixtures/conformance.tsv` marks `import` as `partial`
only for host-provided exact-key imports with aliases, exported const
expressions, pure exported functions, scalar-tree imported UDT constructors
with direct and nested field reads, ordinary same-imported-UDT reassignment, and
scalar-tree imported UDT typed declarations initialized or reassigned from the
same imported identity, same-imported-identity ternary, `if`, `switch`,
`while`, `for`, and `for...in` expression results, plus imported UDT UDF parameter
passthrough returns through direct, block-local alias, ternary-expression alias, final-if alias,
final-`for`, final-`for in`, final-`while`, switch-expression alias, and
nested passthrough chains over those forms, exported functions with
same-imported UDT typed parameters, and scalar-tree root-field replacement in
top-level, branch, `for`-loop, `while`-loop, and UDF-local statement contexts.
Imported pure exported UDFs and imported user methods also return
same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays through direct or block-alias paths,
copy/new/from allocation, private nested calls, final control flow, and typed
method named/reordered arguments. Imported type positions are rewritten for the
active alias, and source-aware metadata keeps calls through two aliases of the
same physical library isolated. Tuple literals and local/imported UDF or method
tuple returns retain same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT-array identity
independently per destructured UDT-array slot, including direct/block/nested/
final-flow, typed-`na`, A-to-B-to-A, dual-alias, tuple-valued ordinary
declaration direct/self alias, ternary/`switch`, assigned-`if`, shadowing, and
later-destructuring paths. A declaration's UDT-array slot identity is stable
across same-identity or `na` reassignment; cross-identity direct/control-flow
reassignment and unresolved nested consumers fail closed at the root span.
Qualified user-defined UDF/method results, unqualified plain local UDF results,
the exact built-in `array.*` producer allowlist, and the cross-namespace
array-capable set in the Built-In Runtime Contract may be consumed directly
through `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`,
`.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, or `.concat(id2)` when they return a currently supported array kind,
including nested copy/read chains. The parser represents the unqualified form
with the impossible synthetic prefix `$call_result` and the built-in producer
form with `$builtin_array_result`; the former requires a plain lexical callee,
while the latter requires either the reserved lexical `array` prefix and an
exact allowlisted member or supported `array.new<T>` template, one of the
seven exact non-`array` qualified producer names. The exact
`matrix.new<float|int|bool|string|color>` templates and namespace `matrix.mult`,
`matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`, `matrix.submatrix`, `matrix.kron`,
`matrix.diff`, `matrix.pow`, `matrix.inv`, `matrix.pinv`, and
`matrix.eigenvectors` use the separate
`$builtin_matrix_result` prefix; semantic analysis admits the five
array helpers when its actual overload returns an array and the exact
`.rows()`/`.columns()`/`.elements_count()`/`.get(row, column)`/`.copy()`/
`.submatrix(...)`/`.transpose()` set for matrix results. `matrix.copy` always takes the matrix
branch and preserves
shape; `matrix.transpose` always takes that branch and swaps shape. Both
preserve the source's supported element kind. `matrix.submatrix` takes the same
branch and returns the selected range with that kind. `matrix.kron` also takes
the matrix branch, produces a fixed float matrix, and expands row/column shape
from its numeric operands, while `matrix.diff` produces a fixed float matrix
with the selected matrix operand's shape and left-to-right subtraction order.
`matrix.pow` produces a fixed float matrix that preserves square shape across
identity, copy, and positive powers, while `matrix.inv` preserves square shape
for invertible inputs and yields `na` for singular or invalid-cell inputs.
`matrix.pinv` swaps rectangular shape, preserves singular matrix-valued
results, returns swapped zero-cell shapes, and yields `na` for invalid-cell
inputs. `matrix.eigenvectors` preserves square shape for real complete
eigenvector results, returns empty `0 x 0`, and yields `na` for invalid-cell,
non-real, or incomplete results. The admitted `matrix.new<T>` templates retain
their float/int/bool/string/color result kind, requested shape,
initial/default-`na` cells, and fresh allocation. Only `.copy()`, `.slice(...)`,
`.concat(id2)`, plus numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()` continue an array-result chain; matrix results
may continue through `.copy()`,
`.submatrix(...)`, or `.transpose()`, and numeric matrix results may also
continue through `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, or `.pow(power)`.
Exact bound matrix-receiver `values.copy()`
results preserve element kind, shape, and independent storage and admit the
same seven all-kind helpers plus `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results. Exact bound
matrix-receiver `values.transpose()` results
share that helper set, preserve element kind, swap shape, and return independent
storage. Exact bound matrix-receiver `values.submatrix(...)` results retain the
source element kind and independent selected range and share the same helper
set. Exact bound numeric-matrix-receiver `values.kron(other)` results expand
shape, return independent `matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper
set. Exact bound numeric-matrix-receiver `values.diff(other)` results preserve
operand direction and selected matrix shape, return independent
`matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper set. Exact bound
numeric-square-matrix-receiver `values.pow(power)` results preserve square
shape across identity, copy, and positive powers, return independent
`matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper set. Exact bound
numeric-square-matrix-receiver `values.inv()` results preserve invertible
square shape, empty `0 x 0` results, and `na` for singular or invalid-cell
inputs, return independent `matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper
set. Exact bound numeric-matrix-receiver `values.pinv()` results swap
rectangular shape, preserve singular matrix results and swapped zero-cell
shapes, yield `na` for invalid-cell inputs, return independent `matrix<float>`
storage, and share the same helper set. Exact bound
numeric-square-matrix-receiver `values.eigenvectors()` results preserve real
square shape, return empty `0 x 0` or `na` at the established boundaries, use
independent `matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper set. Exact bound
numeric-matrix-receiver matrix-valued `values.mult(other)` results preserve
multiplied or scalar-selected shape, `na` and zero-inner-dimension behavior,
return independent `matrix<float>` storage, and share the same helper set while
array-result overloads retain array-helper dispatch; UDF matrix-result
receivers instead enter the same forty-four-helper closed set only for
unqualified local UDFs whose inferred result has a concrete supported matrix
kind, with numeric-only checks retained. Parameter
passthrough, block aliases, nested calls, same-kind control flow, constructed
and matrix-operation returns, named/reordered arguments, zero dimensions, and
independent copies retain their existing behavior and call-specific element
kind. Local and imported user-method results with a concrete supported matrix
kind share those helpers across receiver-style, local-type-qualified or alias-
qualified, direct-constructor-receiver, block/nested/control-flow, five-kind,
zero-dimension, dual-alias, independent-copy, and
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-continuation paths.
Registered imported pure-function results with a concrete supported matrix kind
share those helpers across alias-qualified, block/nested/control-flow, five-
kind, zero-dimension, dual-alias, independent-copy, and
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-continuation
paths. Unknown/`na`, scalar, array, map, unregistered or unresolved user-
function matrix results, broader helpers, mutation other than terminal
`.set(row, column, value)`/`.fill(value)`/`.reverse()`/`.reshape(rows, columns)`/`.swap_rows(row1, row2)`/`.swap_columns(column1, column2)`/`.remove_row(row)`, and continuation after terminal reads remain gated.
Exact supported scalar `map.new<K,V>` templates use `$builtin_map_result` and
admit `.size()`, terminal `.put(key, value)`, `.clear()`, `.remove(key)`, and
`.put_all(source)`, `.get(key)`, `.contains(key)`,
`.copy()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`. Only `.copy()` may continue another
admitted map helper; `.put(...)`, `.clear()`, `.remove(...)`, and `.put_all(...)` return `void`
and cannot continue.
Exact namespace `map.copy(existing)` results share that path while retaining
the source key/value kinds and entries in an independent backing store. Map
mutation outside terminal `.put(...)`/`.clear()`/`.remove(...)`/`.put_all(...)`, unsupported templates, non-map copy
inputs, and other map call-result receivers remain parser/semantic boundaries.
Unqualified local-UDF results with one concrete supported scalar map template
also share those ten helpers and copy-only continuation through `$call_result`;
registered local and imported user-function results plus local and imported
user-method results with the same concrete template use the same result path.
Function calls support unqualified or alias-qualified producers; methods retain
receiver-style and local-type-qualified or alias-qualified producers, with
same-library dual-alias isolation. Unresolved or mixed-template results and
wrong-result helpers remain outside that path. Concrete key/value checks,
insertion-order-preserving replacement/append, local alias writes, fresh-result
isolation, clear/remove behavior, same-template ordered put-all merging,
and UDF-side-effect rejection
retain ordinary map mutation behavior.
Built-in-qualified/template call results outside these paths remain parser
boundaries. For UDT
arrays, the result must carry a concrete same-local or same-imported scalar-tree
identity.
`get` preserves that element identity and the existing named-index, `na`,
negative-index, and bounds semantics; `size` and `last` preserve the existing
empty/typed-`na` behavior.
An unqualified local UDF result carrying a concrete local or imported scalar
UDT identity may also invoke the existing pure user-method subset. Explicit
same-named functions and methods remain distinct from the synthetic array
helper dispatch. Conflicting identities within one scalar return or tuple slot,
non-scalar UDT-array returns, non-array/non-UDT results, unknown/`na` results
without a concrete supported type or identity, helpers outside the read-only
set, built-in-qualified/template call-result receivers outside the exact
static and dynamic collection paths, and mutation through unsupported UDF/method
side-effect contexts remain outside the supported matrix. In particular, postfix reads do
not neutralize `array.concat`'s mutation of its first input, so that producer
remains rejected inside UDFs.
Unresolved-field imported UDT constructors remain rejected with targeted
diagnostics; private library UDTs remain non-exported symbols, local/imported
structural lookalikes remain distinct assignment identities, and duplicate
exported UDT names, UDT/const name collisions, or UDT/function name collisions
are rejected through the shared export table. Scalar-tree imported UDT value
history is fixture-backed, including typed-`na` history for exported imported
UDTs whose scalar-tree metadata depends on private library UDTs. Library
declarations, imported UDT flow outside the covered same-identity scalar-tree paths,
direct private imported UDT access and imported UDT value history outside the scalar-tree metadata subset, imported UDT parameter/global field mutation
inside UDFs, nested imported field mutation, re-exports, remote lookup, and
side-effecting exported functions remain outside the supported matrix. Receiver-style and
alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT method calls are fixture-backed for the
current pure method subset, including named/reordered non-receiver arguments, direct same-identity, block-local alias,
final-if alias, final-for alias, final-for-in alias, final-while alias, switch-expression alias,
nested-method passthrough plus constructor returns, and method-local scalar-tree
root-field replacement.

Local user-defined types are partial. The supported subset is limited to
top-level `type` declarations with scalar int/float/bool/string/color fields,
`Type.new(...)` construction, field reads on local values, ordinary variables,
local for-expression constructor results, `var` persistence for typed local UDT declarations initialized from `na`, same-UDT constructors, same-UDT ternary, switch, if, for, for...in, and while expressions, explicitly typed
same-local scalar-tree UDT `varip` values initialized from `na`, same-UDT
constructors, same-identity aliases, or fixture-backed same-UDT ternary, switch, if, for, for...in, and while expressions, plus
direct-constructor-inferred or direct-alias-inferred same-local scalar-tree UDT `varip` values with
realtime intrabar persistence, and UDF parameter passthrough/returns through
typed or inferred positional or named arguments with direct returns,
block-local, ternary-expression, final-if, final-for, final-for-in, final-while, or switch-expression aliases, or
nested passthrough calls through those same alias forms, plus UDF construction/returns,
directly, through nested pure
constructor-helper UDF calls, or through same-local-UDT ternary, switch, final
if/else constructor branches, same-local-UDT `if` expressions, or final for
bodies, from local UDT parameter scalar fields, scalar fields read through
block-local UDT aliases of those parameters, block-local scalar aliases of
those fields, typed or inferred scalar parameters, or block-local scalar aliases of
those scalar parameters using positional or named constructor field arguments.
Local scalar fields can be reassigned in top-level, branch, `for` loop,
`while` loop, UDF-local variables, and method-local variables. Global or
parameter field mutation inside UDFs, receiver/parameter/global field mutation
inside methods, non-constructor-inferred UDT `varip`, nested-field UDT `varip`,
non-scalar local UDT value history references, UDT fields, UDT array operations beyond
same-local scalar-field `array.new<T>()` construction, `array.from`
construction with size and `array.get` field reads plus `array.set`
replacement, `array.push` append, and `array.pop`
returns, `array.shift` returns, `array.first` reads, and `array.last` reads,
plus `array.clear` reset/reuse, `array.copy` independence, `array.concat`
same-UDT append, `array.slice` parent-window read/write mirroring, and
`array.reverse` reordering, `array.fill` same-UDT replacement, UDT array
`array.join` positional stringification, local field mutation of UDT array
values with explicit same-UDT `array.set`/`set()` writeback, local pure UDF
calls that consume UDT array values, local pure method calls on UDT array values
after binding them to local variables, UDT array
`array.sort`/`array.sort_indices` by `int`, `float`, or `string` `sort_field`,
UDT array id history snapshots, ordinary `var` realtime rollback,
same-local scalar-tree UDT array `varip` backing-store handoff,
scalar-tree imported UDT constructors with direct and nested field reads, and ordinary
same-imported-UDT reassignment, scalar-tree imported UDT typed declarations
initialized or reassigned from the same imported identity, and imported UDT
ternary, `if`, `switch`, `while`, or `for` expression results whose branches resolve
to the same imported identity. Direct, block-local alias, ternary-expression alias, final-if alias,
final-`for`, final-`for in`, final-`while`, switch-expression alias, and
nested imported UDT UDF parameter passthrough returns are also fixture-backed, as are direct, nested, ternary, if, for, for-in, while, or switch imported UDT
constructor-return UDFs. Ordinary imported UDT `var` declarations and
scalar-tree imported UDT `varip` declarations are fixture-backed, as is
scalar-tree imported UDT root-field replacement in top-level, branch, `for`-loop, and
`while`-loop statement contexts plus UDF-local variable mutation in pure
functions. Receiver-style and alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT method calls,
including named/reordered non-receiver arguments, direct same-identity, block-local alias, final-if alias,
final-for alias, final-for-in alias, final-while alias, switch-expression alias, nested-method
passthrough plus constructor returns, and method-local scalar-tree root-field
replacement, are fixture-backed. Same-imported scalar-tree UDT
`array.from` construction is fixture-backed for size, get, first, and last field
reads plus set/set() replacement field reads, push/push() append field reads,
unshift/unshift() prepend field reads, insert/insert() insertion field reads, fill/fill() replacement field reads, join/join() positional stringification, includes/indexof/lastindexof structural equality search, sort/sort_indices by int/float/string sort_field, pop, remove, and shift return field
reads, and clear/clear() size reset plus copy/copy() independent field reads,
reverse/reverse() reordered field reads, slice/slice() window field reads, and
concat/concat() appended field reads, plus same-imported scalar-field
`array<lib.Type>`/`lib.Type[]` declarations. Broader imported UDT flow remains
outside the supported matrix.
User-defined methods are partial for pure methods on local UDT receivers with
scalar or local UDT parameters and direct UDT passthrough returns with caller-side history reads, nested scalar-tree UDT method returns with caller-side history reads, block-local
or ternary-expression receiver or local UDT parameter alias passthrough
returns, final if/else, final for, final for-in, final while, or switch-expression local UDT
alias passthrough returns, nested-method UDT parameter passthrough returns, plus local and nested scalar-tree UDT constructor returns with caller-side history reads, directly, through
nested pure constructor-helper UDF calls, or through same-local-UDT ternary,
switch, final if/else constructor branches, same-local-UDT `if` expressions,
or final for bodies, final for-in bodies, or final while bodies, from receiver or local UDT parameter scalar fields, scalar
fields read through block-local receiver or local UDT parameter aliases,
block-local scalar aliases of those fields, inferred scalar parameters, or
block-local scalar aliases of those parameters using positional or named
constructor field arguments. The receiver
is passed as the first internal parameter. Returned receiver values,
block-local or ternary-expression receiver aliases, final if/else, final for,
final for-in, final while, or switch-expression local UDT aliases, local UDT parameter
values, block-local or ternary-expression local UDT parameter aliases, or
constructed local UDT values may be assigned and field-read at the callsite.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT values read from UDT arrays may also be passed to
local pure UDFs, including passthrough and constructor-return UDFs.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT values read from UDT arrays may also be bound to
local variables and used as receivers for these local pure methods.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT array elements may also be iterated by
statement-form `for...in` loops as value-copy loop locals.
Side effects, recursion, unknown receiver types, alias-qualified imported method
receiver type mismatches, mismatched UDT parameter identity, and unsupported
parameter families remain outside the supported matrix.
The imported UDT subset is intentionally narrow: scalar-tree constructors,
direct and nested field reads, ordinary same-imported-UDT reassignment, explicit
scalar-tree typed declarations, direct UDF parameter passthrough returns
including block-local alias, ternary-expression alias, final-if alias, final-`for`, final-`for in`,
final-`while`, switch-expression alias, and nested passthrough chains, direct, nested, ternary, if, for, for-in, while, or switch constructor-return UDFs,
same-imported-identity ternary/`if`/`switch`/`while`/`for`/`for...in` results, and
scalar-tree root-field replacement in top-level, branch, `for`-loop, `while`-loop, and
UDF-local statement contexts, plus method-local scalar-tree root-field
replacement, carry source-scoped identity through semantic analysis and HIR.
Receiver-style and alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT method calls, including
named/reordered non-receiver arguments, direct same-identity, block-local alias, ternary-expression alias, final-if
alias, final-for alias, final-for-in alias, final-while alias, switch-expression alias,
nested-method passthrough plus
direct, nested scalar-tree, ternary, if, for, for-in, while, or switch
constructor returns, caller-side history reads from method-returned values, and
method-local scalar-tree root-field replacement, are
supported, while collections, history, nested field mutation,
UDF parameter/global field side effects, method receiver/parameter/global field
side effects, and broader imported UDT value flow remain a maintenance tail.
The closed Phase J boundary and maintenance tails are summarized in
`docs/PHASE_J_AUDIT.md`.

Hosts may pass library source text into semantic analysis as future graph input:

- CLI accepts repeated `--library-source KEY=path.pine` options for `analyze`
  and `run`. The CLI owns filesystem reads and passes source text to core.
- Python accepts `library_sources={"KEY": "source text"}` on `compile_script`,
  `analyze_script`, and `run_script`.
- WASM accepts deterministic JSON library source maps on the
  `*WithLibraries` entry points and routes them through the same shared
  `AnalysisInput` path.

Core crates must not perform filesystem, network, clock, or host registry I/O
for library resolution. Library source keys are deterministic host-provided
identifiers: empty keys, keys containing whitespace/control characters, and
duplicate keys are rejected before analysis. Cache keys include root source
name/text and every host-provided library key/name/text so future import graph
use cannot reuse stale analysis.

CLI and WASM runtime JSON must be generated through the shared runtime contract
helper so field names and nesting cannot drift. Python returns native
dictionaries, so its binding tests assert the same top-level runtime keys and
representative nested output families such as `plotShapes` and `plotCandles`.
The Phase E drawing-object scaffold adds `labels`, `lines`, `boxes`, and
`tables` as top-level runtime keys in `schemaVersion: 2`. The executable label
subset covers `label.new` creation snapshots with bar-index or bar-time x
locations, price/abovebar/belowbar y locations, official label styles, official
empty-string defaults for omitted text, `color.blue` and `color.white` defaults
for omitted color/textcolor values, and host-neutral text metadata, plus the
`chart.point` point/text overload using
point indexes or times based on `xloc`, selected `label.set_*` mutators including
fixture-backed `label.set_x`, `label.set_y`, `label.set_xy`, `label.set_text`,
`label.set_point`, and `label.set_size` mutations from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks, where `label.set_point` selects `point.index`
or `point.time` from the point based on the label's current `xloc` and uses
`point.price` for y, fixture-backed `label.set_color`, `label.set_textcolor`,
`label.set_style`, `label.set_tooltip`, `label.set_textalign`,
`label.set_text_font_family`, and `label.set_text_formatting` mutations from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks,
fixture-backed x-location snapshot mutation for `label.set_xloc`, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, and
y-location snapshot mutation for `label.set_yloc`, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, text-alignment snapshot
mutation for `label.set_textalign`, text font-family snapshot mutation for
`label.set_text_font_family`, text-formatting snapshot mutation for
`label.set_text_formatting`, `label.delete` deletion snapshots, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow deletion coverage,
fixture-backed cloning with `label.copy`, including ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow cloning coverage, and the fixture-backed `label.get_x`,
`label.get_y`, and
`label.get_text` getters over the latest existing label snapshot, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow read coverage for all three
getters, statement-form `array<label>` `for...in` shallow-id iteration with
getter/setter calls and setter visibility through the source array id, plus
`label.all` existing-label id reads, including ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow read coverage, with default 50/named 1-500
`max_labels_count` oldest-active label eviction before new creation. The
executable line subset covers `line.new` x1/y1/x2/y2 creation with optional
xloc, extend, color, style, and width initialization for existing host-neutral
snapshot fields when `xloc` is omitted, `xloc.bar_index`, or `xloc.bar_time`,
with omitted color defaulting to `color.blue`, plus the `chart.point`
first_point/second_point overload using point indexes or times according to
`xloc`. It also covers selected
endpoint/color/width/style/extend mutators, `line.set_first_point` and
`line.set_second_point` using point indexes or times according to each line's
current `xloc`, and `line.set_xloc` for the `xloc.bar_index`/`xloc.bar_time`
subset that updates x1, x2, and xloc snapshots, all including ordinary
and independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, `line.delete`
deletion snapshots, including ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
deletion coverage,
fixture-backed cloning with `line.copy`, including ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow cloning coverage, statement-form `array<line>`
`for...in` shallow-id iteration with getter/setter calls and setter visibility
through the source array id, `line.all` reads from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, fixture-backed `line.get_x1`,
`line.get_y1`, `line.get_x2`, and `line.get_y2` reads from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and fixture-backed
`line.get_price` getter over the latest existing line snapshot, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow reads, with sparse snapshots
and default 50/named 1-500 `max_lines_count` eviction that appends deletion
snapshots to the oldest active line before creating new ones.
Label style and line style/extend parameters use a bounded dynamic-enum
contract. Series/input strings are accepted only when immutable initializer
provenance, complete conditional branches, or explicit string-input `options`
show that every possible value is an official supported enum. Unbounded
strings and domains containing any invalid value remain analysis errors.
Pine v4 `label.style_labelup` and `label.style_labeldown` are translated to the
current underscored constants before lowering; v5/v6 do not activate those
legacy spellings.
`line.get_price` uses bar-index x1/y1/x2/y2 interpolation and extrapolation and
returns `na` for `na`, deleted, vertical, nonnumeric, or time-coordinate lines;
timestamp interpolation remains unsupported. The executable box subset covers
`box.new` left/top/right/bottom creation plus `chart.point`
top_left/bottom_right creation with optional xloc, background, border, extend,
text, text-color, text-size, horizontal-alignment, vertical-alignment,
text-wrap, font-family, and text-formatting initialization for existing
host-neutral snapshot fields when `xloc` is omitted, `xloc.bar_index`, or
`xloc.bar_time`. Omitted `border_color` and `bgcolor` use the official
`color.blue` default, omitted `text_color` uses the official `color.black`
default, and omitted `text_size` uses the official `size.auto` default.
It also covers selected geometry mutators from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks, selected background/border/extend mutators from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, selected
text/text-color/text-size/horizontal-alignment/vertical-alignment/text-wrap/
font-family/text-formatting mutators from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks, and `box.set_top_left_point` plus
`box.set_bottom_right_point` using point indexes or times according to each
box's current `xloc`,
`box.set_xloc` for the `xloc.bar_index`/`xloc.bar_time` subset that updates
left, right, and xloc snapshots from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks,
`box.delete` from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and
fixture-backed cloning with `box.copy` over the latest existing box
snapshot from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, `box.all`
reads from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks after deletion, fixture-backed
`box.get_left`, `box.get_right`, `box.get_top`, and `box.get_bottom` reads from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks after mutation, with
sparse snapshots plus default 50/named 1-500 `max_boxes_count` oldest-active
box eviction before new creation.
The executable table subset covers
`table.new` position/dimension creation with optional `bgcolor`,
`frame_color`, `frame_width`, `border_color`, and `border_width` initialization,
plus accepted `force_overlay` syntax (without public-output propagation or pane
routing),
plus `table.cell` text/background/text-color/tooltip/font-family/text-formatting
cell writes,
`table.set_position` final-position mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage,
`table.set_bgcolor` final background-color mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage,
`table.set_frame_color` final frame-color mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage,
`table.set_frame_width` final frame-width mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage,
`table.set_border_color` final border-color mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage,
`table.set_border_width` final border-width mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, `table.delete` deletion
snapshots, including ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow deletion
coverage, `table.clear` inclusive rectangular
cell-content removal snapshots, including ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow clearing coverage,
`table.merge_cells` inclusive merged-cell rectangle snapshots, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow merge coverage, and
`table.cell_set_text` text mutations, including ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_bgcolor`
background color mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_text_color` text-color
mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow mutation
coverage, plus `table.cell_set_width` width mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, plus
`table.cell_set_height` height mutations, including ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_text_size`
text-size mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_text_halign` horizontal
text-alignment mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_text_valign` vertical
text-alignment mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow mutation coverage, plus `table.cell_set_text_wrap` text-wrap
mutations, including ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow mutation
coverage, plus `table.cell_set_tooltip` tooltip mutations, including ordinary
and independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, plus
`table.cell_set_text_font_family` font-family mutations, including ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, plus
`table.cell_set_text_formatting` text-formatting mutations, including
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow mutation coverage, for previously populated cells
with
deterministic table dimensions, a 50-table runtime limit, and a 1000-cell
per-table limit. `table.all` returns currently existing table ids in creation
order, including when read from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
blocks after table deletion. Supported label, line, box, and table id-first drawing
functions can also use Pine method syntax, where the object receiver becomes
the first function argument; for example, `id.set_text("x")` is analyzed and
lowered as `label.set_text(id, "x")` when `id` is a label. This method syntax
does not widen the supported method set: unsupported drawing methods and
unsupported box chart-point coordinate variants remain unsupported.
Deleting `na`,
mutating `na`, or mutating an already deleted
drawing object is a no-op where deletion exists; supported label getters return
`na` for `na` or deleted label ids; invalid non-`na` ids are runtime errors; ids
are stable and not reused. `label.new` can initialize host-neutral label
`xloc` values `xloc.bar_index`/`xloc.bar_time`, including from a `chart.point`
by selecting `point.index` or `point.time`, `yloc` values `yloc.price`,
`yloc.abovebar`, and `yloc.belowbar`, text fields with empty-string defaults
when omitted, color/text-color fields with official `color.blue`/`color.white`
defaults when omitted, official `label.style_*` values, size constants or
integer sizes, `textalign`,
`text_font_family`, and `text_formatting` snapshot fields; its `force_overlay`
argument is accepted but left to the host display layer.
`label.set_x`, `label.set_y`, `label.set_xy`, `label.set_point`,
`label.set_text`, and `label.set_size` update the latest existing label
snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks. `label.set_point` uses the label's current `xloc` to
select `point.index` or `point.time` for x and uses `point.price` for y.
`label.set_color`, `label.set_textcolor`, `label.set_style`,
`label.set_tooltip`, `label.set_textalign`, `label.set_text_font_family`, and
`label.set_text_formatting` update their host-neutral snapshot fields, including
when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks.
`label.set_style` accepts the official label style constants and stores the
selected constant in the latest label snapshot.
`label.set_xloc` records `xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` plus the new `x`
value in label snapshots, including when called from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks; `label.set_yloc` records `yloc.price`,
`yloc.abovebar`, or `yloc.belowbar`, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks; `label.set_textalign` records horizontal text alignment
in label snapshots. `label.set_text_font_family` records font
family in label snapshots. `label.set_text_formatting` records a
`text.format_none`/`text.format_bold`/`text.format_italic` bitmask, including
bold+italic combinations, while actual glyph styling remains host-specific.
Text layout remains host-specific. `label.delete` appends an `exists: false`
label snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks.
`label.copy` clones the latest existing label
snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, returns `na` for `na` or deleted
labels, and shares the effective label limit. `label.get_x` reads the latest
existing label x-coordinate,
including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted labels. `label.get_y` reads the
latest existing label y-coordinate, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na` for `na` or deleted
labels.
`label.get_text` reads the latest existing label text, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks, and returns `na`
for `na` or deleted labels. `label.all` returns currently existing label ids in
creation order, including when read from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks after label deletion or max-count eviction. Selected
`line.set_*` mutators update
endpoint/color/width/style/extend snapshots, and `line.set_xloc` with
`xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` updates x1, x2, and xloc snapshot values,
including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow
blocks. `line.delete` appends an
`exists: false` line snapshot, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `line.copy` clones the latest
existing line snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks,
returns `na` for `na` or deleted lines, and shares the effective line runtime
limit.
`line.all` returns currently existing line ids in creation order, including
when read from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks after
line deletion or max-count eviction.
`box.copy` clones the latest existing box
snapshot into a new deterministic id, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks, returns `na` for `na` or deleted
boxes, and shares the effective box limit. `box.set_bgcolor`,
`box.set_border_color`, `box.set_border_width`, `box.set_border_style`, and
`box.set_extend` update box style snapshots, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `box.set_xloc` with
`xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time` updates left, right, and xloc values in box
snapshots, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks. `box.set_left`, `box.set_top`,
`box.set_right`, `box.set_bottom`, `box.set_lefttop`, and
`box.set_rightbottom` update box geometry snapshots, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `box.set_text`,
`box.set_text_color`, `box.set_text_size`, `box.set_text_halign`,
`box.set_text_valign`, `box.set_text_wrap`, `box.set_text_font_family`, and
`box.set_text_formatting` update box text snapshots, including when called from
ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `box.set_text_formatting`
records a `text.format_none`/`text.format_bold`/`text.format_italic` bitmask,
including bold+italic combinations, while actual glyph styling remains
host-specific.
Richer box text layout remains unsupported. `box.get_left`,
`box.get_right`, `box.get_top`, and `box.get_bottom` read the latest existing
box snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks, and return `na` for `na` or deleted boxes; other box
methods remain unsupported. `table.set_position` updates only the table's final
position value, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks, with table layout left to hosts. `table.new` optional `bgcolor`,
`frame_color`, `frame_width`, `border_color`, and `border_width` initialize only
the table's final background-color, frame-color, frame-width, border-color, and
border-width values. `force_overlay` is accepted, but its value is not exposed
in public output and pane routing remains unsupported.
`table.delete` appends an `exists: false` table snapshot, including when called
from ordinary and independent while-loop control-flow blocks. `table.clear` removes
already populated cells in the inclusive rectangular range from `start_column`,
`start_row` to `end_column`, `end_row`, including when called from ordinary and
independent while-loop control-flow blocks; it also removes merged-cell records
that intersect the cleared range, while preserving the table object and
table-level style fields.
`table.merge_cells` appends inclusive
`start_column`/`start_row` to `end_column`/`end_row` merge rectangles to the
host-neutral table snapshot, including when called from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks; deleted or `na` table ids are no-ops, invalid
non-`na` ids are runtime
errors, and out-of-bounds, reversed, or overlapping merge ranges are runtime
errors. Later table-level and cell mutations of
deleted tables are no-ops.
`table.set_bgcolor`, `table.set_frame_color`, `table.set_frame_width`,
`table.set_border_color`, and `table.set_border_width` update only the table's
final style values, including when called from ordinary and independent
while-loop control-flow blocks; border rendering and table layout remain host
responsibilities. `table.cell_set_text`, `table.cell_set_bgcolor`,
`table.cell_set_text_color`, `table.cell_set_width`, `table.cell_set_height`,
`table.cell_set_text_size`, `table.cell_set_text_halign`,
`table.cell_set_text_valign`, `table.cell_set_text_wrap`,
`table.cell_set_tooltip`, `table.cell_set_text_font_family`, and
`table.cell_set_text_formatting` update only previously populated cell
snapshots, including when called from ordinary and independent while-loop
control-flow blocks, while preserving other supported fields. Visual layout,
text wrapping, tooltip display, font rendering, and bold/italic rendering
remain host-specific;
other table cell text rendering remains host-specific.
Supported drawing creation, mutation, cloning, getter, and cell writes are covered under realtime rollback where state
changes. Pine v4 UDF bodies additionally admit the exact namespace-call subset
`label.new/delete` and `line.new/delete`; every other drawing side effect inside
user-defined functions remains rejected. Keep unsupported coordinate modes and advanced object
methods out of the supported matrix until they have fixtures and public-output
coverage. `linefill.new` and `linefill.set_color` are partial: they create
runtime-owned linefill ids over supported line ids, emit sparse color snapshots,
mutate colors, return referenced line ids through `linefill.get_line1` and
`linefill.get_line2`, and replace the previous linefill for the same line pair.
`linefill.delete` appends deletion snapshots, including while-loop
control-flow deletes, statement-form `array<linefill>` `for...in` shallow-id
iteration supports getter/setter calls with setter visibility through linefill
snapshots and source array ids, and `linefill.all` returns currently existing
linefill ids in creation order while omitting replaced or deleted linefills.
`array.new_linefill` and `array.from` support linefill id arrays for generic
object-array storage, mutation, reads, and search; numeric, truth, sorting, and
join helpers still reject linefill arrays with type diagnostics. `chart.point`
is partial: `chart.point.new`, `chart.point.now`,
`chart.point.from_index`, `chart.point.from_time`, and `chart.point.copy`
construct/copy point values, and top-level `time`, `index`, and `price` field
reads and mutation are fixture-backed. Single `chart.point` value history is
fixture-backed for constant offsets, dynamic `na` offsets, retained previous
values after current-point field mutation, UDF-returned and method-returned
point values, and
`if`/`switch`/`for`/`for...in`/`while` expression results. Ordinary
`var chart.point` values roll back field mutation between repeated forming
realtime updates,
while single `chart.point` value `varip` declarations persist point values
intrabar by value, including field-mutation writeback and committed/realtime
confirmed-bar history reads with constant and dynamic offsets. Scalar and
`chart.point` typed UDF parameters are fixture-backed for constructor-returned points,
read-only passthrough, caller-side field reads, and history reads. Scalar,
object-id, `chart.point`, same-local scalar-tree UDT array, and same-imported
scalar-tree UDT array typed UDF parameters are fixture-backed for `array<T>` and
`T[]` syntax, including named same-imported UDT array arguments, caller-side
history reads from returned imported UDT array elements, typed argument
rejection, and history reads from UDF results. Scalar, `chart.point`, scalar-array, object-id-array,
chart.point-array, same-local scalar-tree UDT array, and same-imported
scalar-tree UDT array typed method parameters are fixture-backed, including
`array<T>`/`T[]` syntax, receiver-style and alias-qualified imported method
calls, named same-imported UDT array arguments, caller-side history reads from
returned imported UDT array elements, and typed argument rejection.
`array.new<chart.point>()` can construct chart-point arrays,
`array.from(chart.point, ...)` can infer chart-point arrays, and the generic
storage/read/mutation/search subset can carry point values.
Label, line, linefill, box, and table arrays may also be iterated by statement-form
`for...in` as shallow-id loop locals with getter/setter, cell-write, or
lifecycle calls and visibility through the source array id, linefill snapshots,
or `box.all`/`table.all` deletion state. Polyline arrays may also be iterated by
statement-form `for...in` as shallow-id loop locals with deletion visible
through `polyline.all`. Chart-point arrays may also be iterated by
statement-form value-only or index/value `for...in` as value-copy loop locals
with field reads and local field mutation that does not write back to the source
slot.
`array.new<T>()` and `array.from` can construct same-local scalar-tree UDT
arrays for value-only and index/value `for...in` value-copy iteration,
`array.size`, method `size()`, namespace `array.get`, method `get()` field
reads, and
same-UDT `array.set`/`set()` replacement, `array.push`/`push()` append, and
`array.pop`/`pop()` returns plus `array.shift`/`shift()` returns,
`array.first`/`first()` and `array.last`/`last()` reads,
including direct `array.new<T>()` empty-array `na` returns for first, last,
pop, and shift,
`array.clear`/`clear()` reset/reuse, `array.copy`/`copy()` independence,
`array.concat`/`concat()` same-UDT append,
`array.slice`/`slice()` parent-window read/write mirroring, and
`array.reverse`/`reverse()` reordering, plus `array.insert`/`insert()`
same-UDT insertion, `array.remove`/`remove()` returns, and
`array.unshift`/`unshift()` same-UDT prepend; typed `array<T>`/`T[]`
declarations are supported for the same local scalar-tree UDT array subset.
Same-imported scalar-tree UDT `array.from` construction is also fixture-backed
for `array.size`, namespace/method `array.get`, namespace/method
`array.first`/`array.last` field reads, namespace/method
`array.set`/`set()` replacement field reads, namespace/method
`array.push`/`push()` append field reads, namespace/method
`array.unshift`/`unshift()` prepend field reads, namespace/method
`array.insert`/`insert()` insertion field reads, namespace/method
`array.pop`/`array.remove`/`array.shift` return field reads, and
`array.clear`/`clear()` size reset plus `array.copy`/`copy()` independent field
reads, `array.reverse`/`reverse()` reordered field reads,
`array.slice`/`slice()` window field reads, and `array.concat`/`concat()`
appended field reads.
Same-local and same-imported scalar-tree UDT array identities are preserved
through ternary, `if`, `switch`, `for`, `for...in`, and `while` expression
results, including array/`na` branches and block-local aliases. Those results
can initialize typed or inferred declarations and be consumed by the existing
array helper, history, and iteration subsets. Mixed UDT identities remain
diagnostic-only unsupported.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT array id history snapshots are fixture-backed and
clone the committed array before historical reads. Same-local scalar-tree UDT
array `varip` declarations retain array ids, backing contents, and UDT element
identity across realtime forming updates. Mixed UDT values, non-scalar imported
UDT arrays, nested-field UDT values, and nested-field UDT `varip` remain unsupported. Ordinary `var` UDT arrays roll
back their backing store during realtime forming updates.
`polyline.new` can consume those arrays and copy their values into host-neutral
runtime snapshots, while `polyline.delete` and `polyline.all` cover the
historical and forming-bar rollback lifecycle subset. Omitted `line_color`
uses the official `color.blue` default in runtime snapshots. `polyline.new`
uses the runtime default 50-polyline limit and named `max_polylines_count`
declaration values from 1 through 100 to evict oldest active polyline
snapshots before creating new ones. `line.new`, `line.set_first_point`,
`line.set_second_point`, `box.new`, `box.set_top_left_point`,
`box.set_bottom_right_point`, `label.new`, and `label.set_point` can consume
`chart.point` values. `box.new` chart-point snapshots use the same official
default `border_color`, `bgcolor`, `text_color`, and `text_size` values as the
scalar overload when those arguments are omitted. `chart.point` typed
declarations are fixture-backed for chart-point or `na` initializers, including
`if`/`switch`/`for`/`while` expression results. Polyline
id arrays are fixture-backed through
`array.new_polyline`, official `array.new<polyline>` template syntax, typed
`array<polyline>`/`polyline[]` declarations, `array.from(polyline, ...)`,
the generic object-array helper subset, and array/slice history snapshots.
UDT arrays remain outside generic array mutation semantics until broader
copy/deep-copy rules are designed; the current UDT array subset is limited to
same-local scalar-field `array.new<T>()` and
`array.from(...)` construction with `array.size`/`size()` reads,
`array.get`/`get()` field reads,
same-UDT `array.set`/`set()` replacement, and same-UDT `array.push`/`push()`
append, plus `array.pop`/`pop()` and `array.shift`/`shift()` returns and
`array.first`/`first()` and `array.last`/`last()` reads, plus
`array.clear`/`clear()` reset/reuse, `array.copy`/`copy()` independence, and
`array.concat`/`concat()` same-UDT append, `array.slice`/`slice()`
parent-window read/write mirroring, `array.reverse`/`reverse()` reordering, and
`array.insert`/`insert()` same-UDT insertion, plus `array.remove`/`remove()`
returns, `array.unshift`/`unshift()` same-UDT prepend, `array.sort`/`sort()`
by an `int`, `float`, or `string` `sort_field`, `array.sort_indices`/
`sort_indices()` by the same `sort_field` subset returning original indexes
without mutating the source array, same-local scalar-tree UDT `array<T>` and
`T[]` typed declarations, same-local scalar-tree UDT `array.includes`,
`array.indexof`, and `array.lastindexof` structural equality search,
`array.fill`/`fill()` same-UDT replacement over valid half-open ranges,
`array.join`/`join()` positional UDT stringification,
local field mutation of UDT values read from arrays with explicit same-UDT
`array.set`/`set()` writeback, direct chained slot field mutation through
`array.get(points, index).field := value` or `points.get(index).field := value`
with slice-window parent mirroring,
local pure UDF calls that consume UDT values read from arrays,
local pure method calls on UDT values read from arrays into local variables,
same-local scalar-tree UDT array id history snapshots including dynamic na-offset predicate output, same-local scalar-tree
UDT array statement-form `for...in` value-copy loop variables with field reads
and local field mutation that does not write back to the source slot, and
ordinary `var` realtime rollback, plus same-local scalar-tree UDT array
`varip` backing-store handoff across realtime forming updates.

Phase H reserves `alerts` as a top-level runtime key in `schemaVersion: 3`.
The first supported alert subsets are `alertcondition(condition, title,
message)` with bool-compatible conditions, const-string titles, and
const-string messages, plus fixture-backed OHLCV placeholder interpolation for
`{{open}}`, `{{high}}`, `{{low}}`, `{{close}}`, and `{{volume}}`, plus
`{{ticker}}`, `{{interval}}`, `{{exchange}}`, and `{{time}}`, in the
`alertcondition` message only. `{{time}}` uses the existing UTC
`str.format_time` default format for the triggering bar timestamp.
`alert(message, freq?)` supports string-compatible dynamic messages and the fixture-backed
`alert.freq_once_per_bar`/`alert.freq_all`/`alert.freq_once_per_bar_close`
frequency subset. Reached true alert conditions and reached alert calls emit
`{id, barIndex, time, message, source}` events in program order, subject to
supported `alert()` frequency filtering; false and `na` alert conditions emit
nothing. Forming realtime events are visible in the forming result and roll back
until a confirmed update commits an event, while close-frequency alert calls are
suppressed on forming updates and emitted only on historical or confirmed
bar-close execution. Repeated forming updates recompute alert events from the
confirmed snapshot, so abandoned forming events are neither retained nor
duplicated, and a confirmed update matches the equivalent historical execution
where the same final bar data is available. TradingView-style `{{...}}` alert
placeholder interpolation outside the supported `alertcondition` message
placeholder subset remains unsupported; supported `alert()` messages are
serialized literally.

The official Pine Logs functions `log.info()`, `log.warning()`, and
`log.error()` remain unsupported. They require a host-owned log pane or runtime
output contract, so the analyzer reports them as explicit unsupported `log.*`
calls instead of treating them as unknown functions.

Pine map collections are partial. `map.new<K, V>()` accepts scalar key/value
templates using `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, or `color` and returns a
runtime-owned empty map id. `map.size(id)` returns the current entry count for
map ids. `map.put`, `map.get`, and `map.contains` are supported for those
scalar key/value templates; put inserts or replaces entries, get returns `na`
for missing keys, and contains returns key presence. `map.clear` removes all
entries from the map id. `map.remove` deletes a present key and is a no-op for
missing keys. Assignment aliases the runtime map id, while `map.copy` returns an
independent cloned backing store with the same scalar key/value template.
`map.keys` and `map.values` return independent insertion-order array snapshots.
`map.put_all` merges entries from a source map into a target map with the same
scalar key/value template, replacing existing values without moving their order
and appending new keys in source insertion order.
Direct `for key in id` and `for [key, value] in id` iteration is fixture-backed
for scalar maps in insertion order, including statement and expression forms.
The key-only loop local uses the map key template kind; in key/value form, the
first loop local uses the map key template kind and the second loop local uses
the map value template kind. Changing the map size from a direct map `for...in`
body reports a runtime error.
Ordinary realtime rollback restores map-store mutations from the confirmed
runtime snapshot. Equivalent method aliases are supported for the same subset:
`id.size()`, `id.put(key, value)`, `id.get(key)`, `id.contains(key)`,
`id.clear()`, `id.remove(key)`, `id.copy()`, `id.keys()`, and `id.values()`.
`id.put_all(source)` is also supported. Scalar `map<K,V>` typed declarations
preserve map template metadata for compatible or `na` initialization and
same-template reassignment. Bare scalar `map` declarations initialized from
known scalar map expressions infer the same template metadata. Scalar map history snapshots are supported with
independent historical copies. Scalar map `varip` handoff retains map ids and
backing stores across repeated realtime forming updates. Read-only map helper
calls can consume map ids passed through user-defined function parameters when
the map template is known at the caller. Template-less bare map declarations,
non-scalar templates, and non-map map receivers remain unsupported.

Pine matrix collections are partial. Runtime-owned `matrix<float>` ids support
`matrix.new<float>`, `matrix.get`, `matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.concat`,

`values.add_row(row, array_id)`, and
`values.add_col(column, array_id)`, `values.remove_row(row)`, and

bare matrix or matrix templates beyond float/int/bool/string/color typed
declarations remain unsupported until their semantics are designed and
fixture-backed.
Statement-form matrix `for...in` iteration is fixture-backed over row snapshots
with optional row-index binding. `matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`,
`matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and `matrix<color>` typed declarations are
fixture-backed. Matrix history is fixture-backed for committed, shape, and
dynamic-offset matrix snapshots that return fresh copies.
Matrix `varip` declarations for `matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`,
`matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, and `matrix<color>` retain matrix ids and
backing contents across realtime forming updates.

Runtime strategy order-fill alert payloads are exposed under `strategy.alerts`
for supported strategy fills in the current runtime schema. Runtime
`schemaVersion: 5` added host-neutral `textWrap` to table cell snapshots.
Runtime `schemaVersion: 6` added top-level `lineFills` snapshots for the
supported linefill subset. Runtime `schemaVersion: 7` is current and adds
top-level `polylines` snapshots for the supported `polyline.new` and lifecycle
subset. The
top-level `alerts[]` array remains limited to reached `alert()` and
`alertcondition()` callsites. Explicit Python, CLI, and WASM host helpers can render
`{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` from selected public strategy fill events,
while external alert delivery remains unsupported.

Checked-in golden JSON snapshots live in `tests/snapshots/`. Snapshot tests are
strict string comparisons against deterministic compact JSON; a public field
rename, omitted `schemaVersion`, or matrix shape change should fail tests. To
refresh snapshots after an intentional public-output change, run:

```text
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p pine-cli runtime_outputs_match_golden_snapshots
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p pine-cli matrix_output_matches_golden_snapshot
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p pine-wasm analysis_outputs_match_golden_snapshots
cargo test --workspace
```

Review the resulting JSON diff before committing. Do not update snapshots to
hide accidental public contract changes.

Snapshot maintenance rules:

- Treat checked-in snapshots as public contract evidence, not generated noise.
- Update snapshots only with the targeted `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` commands above.
- Include the source change, snapshot diff, and documentation update in the
  same commit when a public output change is intentional.
- Run `scripts/verify.sh` after any snapshot refresh so CLI, WASM, Python, and
  matrix contracts are checked together.

## Numeric Tolerance

Floating point outputs should be compared with an explicit tolerance:

```text
absolute tolerance: 1e-10
relative tolerance: 1e-9
```

Some built-ins may need per-function tolerances if their documented formulas
accumulate rounding differently. Any wider tolerance must be justified in the
fixture metadata.

## Test Data

OHLCV fixtures should be small and deterministic.

Rules:

- Include enough bars to test warmup behavior.
- Include gaps or flat sections where indicators often fail.
- Include first-bar and out-of-range history cases.
- Do not depend on external market data downloads in unit tests.

## Unsupported Features

Unsupported fixtures are first-class tests.

Examples:

- unsupported `request.security` variants outside the same-context identity
  scalar/tuple-literal subset and same-or-higher-timeframe provider
  scalar/tuple-literal subset
- unsupported strategy declaration contexts and strategy order variants outside
  the fixture-backed `strategy.order` subset; `strategy.exit` same-side pairs,
  custom OCA parameters, 3+ triggers, invalid trailing combinations, and
  arbitrary future binding for
  unmatched `from_entry` ids remain fixture-backed unsupported cases.
  Stop-only `strategy.exit(id, from_entry, stop=price)`, limit-only
  `strategy.exit(id, from_entry, limit=price)`, profit-only
  `strategy.exit(id, from_entry, profit=ticks)`, loss-only
  `strategy.exit(id, from_entry, loss=ticks)`, and exactly one-downside plus
  one-upside brackets (`stop + limit`, `stop + profit`, `loss + limit`,
  `loss + profit`), plus trailing stops (`trail_price + trail_offset` and
  `trail_points + trail_offset`), optionally with fixed `qty` or `qty_percent`,
  are the narrow supported subsets for the current one-net-long broker.
  Supported brackets use
  stop/loss-first precedence when both legs are touched on the same eligible
  historical bar. Supported trailing stops do not fill on the activation bar
  and ratchet only upward after activation. Supported fixed `qty` exits close
  `min(qty, position_size)`, keep any remaining long position open at the same
  average price, and do not add public pending-order or remaining-quantity
  fields. Supported `qty_percent` exits evaluate the percent at placement time,
  resolve it to an absolute quantity against the current position size or the
  matching pending entry quantity for same-calculation absolute exit attachment,
  clamp fills to the current position, and expose only the absolute filled `qty`.
  When supported `strategy.exit` shapes supply both `qty` and `qty_percent`,
  fixed `qty` determines the reserved or filled quantity and `qty_percent` is
  ignored.
- minimal `strategy.entry` long market, long limit, long stop, and long
  stop-limit entries in strategy-mode scripts; market entries fill at the next
  historical bar open, limit and stop entries fill on a later historical bar
  when the selected open-high-low-close or open-low-high-close path visits the
  trigger, high-first long stop-limit entries may fill on the same bar after
  activation, short and low-first stop-limit fills stay fail-closed until a
  later bar, and no public pending-order output is exposed; unsupported
  short/indicator-mode variants are fixture-backed; entries may omit `qty`
  only when the strategy declaration configures the fixed default quantity
  subset
- minimal `strategy.close` full-position closes for matching long entry ids,
  with flat, wrong-entry, or repeated closes treated as no-op
- minimal `strategy.close_all` full-position closes for the current supported
  long position, with flat or already-closed calls treated as no-op
- minimal `strategy.cancel(id)` cancellation for matching supported internal
  pending entry, generic-order, exit, deferred-relative, and close ids,
  including shared public ids across those families; filled, unknown, and
  already-cancelled ids are no-op, and no public pending-order or cancellation
  records are exposed
- minimal `strategy.cancel_all()` cancellation for all supported internal
  pending entries, generic orders, exits, reservations, deferred relative
  exits, pending closes, stop-limit activation, and OCA membership; calling it
  without pending orders is a no-op, and no public pending-order or
  cancellation records are exposed
- minimal strategy equity snapshots with bar-close mark-to-market accounting,
  with broader broker settings and rich strategy reporting variables
  unsupported
- unsupported strategy reporting helpers beyond the supported position,
  profit, equity, run-up/drawdown, and trade-count variables, plus unknown `strategy.*`
  reporting helpers
- unsupported collection families or unsupported array variants
- unsupported label and line methods
- unsupported import variants outside the host-provided alias/exported
  const/pure-function subset
- unsupported `varip` forms such as drawing ids, drawing-id typed arrays,
  tuples, and value families outside the scalar, scalar typed-array,
  `chart.point` typed-array, scalar map/matrix, scalar-tree UDT/UDT-array, and
  explicit non-scalar UDT typed-na subset
- non-integer or negative history offsets
- unsupported function side effects, including drawing, alert, strategy order,
  and UDT parameter field mutation side effects

Expected result:

- no panic
- stable diagnostic code
- source span
- machine-readable compatibility report entry

## Diagnostic Stability

Diagnostics should include:

```text
code
severity
message
span
feature id when applicable
help text when useful
```

Messages can improve over time, but codes should remain stable once published.

## Comparison Policy

Allowed comparison sources:

- public language documentation
- original mathematical formulas
- project-owned fixtures
- permissively licensed scripts with metadata
- user-provided scripts when the user has the right to use them

Disallowed:

- copied proprietary scripts
- private TradingView APIs
- scraped TradingView data
- copied official documentation text beyond short references
- TradingView UI or error text reproduction

## Release Compatibility Matrix

Every release should publish a generated or manually maintained matrix:

independent fixed-float matrices with multiplied or preserved shape, numeric-array operands yield independent float arrays with one value per receiver row, and the resolved result selects the closed matrix or array helper set while retaining numeric operand gates, na propagation, zero-inner-dimension behavior, multiplication order, matrix cell-budget and dimension errors, and vector-length

```

The matrix should be generated from conformance metadata once the test harness
exists.

Request support must cite request-specific fixtures. The conformance validator
rejects supported or partial `request.*` rows that only point at unrelated
runtime fixtures, so public request claims stay tied to request host-data,
semantic, or runtime coverage. The closed Phase F request boundary and
maintenance tails are summarized in `docs/PHASE_F_AUDIT.md`.

Current CLI output:

```text
pine-compat matrix
pine-compat matrix --format json
```

The generated matrix is derived from `tests/fixtures/conformance.tsv`. Each row
declares a feature, status, notes, and one or more fixture paths that back the
claim. CLI tests verify that every matrix entry references at least one existing
fixture. The text matrix includes the fixture paths, and the JSON matrix exposes
top-level matrix `schemaVersion` plus a `features` array whose entries expose
fixture paths as `fixtures`.

Conformance metadata is validated before matrix output is trusted:

- `feature` must be non-empty and unique.
- `status` must be `supported`, `partial`, or `unsupported`.
- `notes` must be non-empty.
- `fixtures` must contain at least one path and no empty `;` entries.
- Every fixture path must exist in the workspace.
- `supported` and `partial` entries must cite executable, realtime, syntax,
  positive semantic, or regression coverage.
- `unsupported` entries must cite unsupported semantic diagnostic fixtures or
  syntax diagnostic fixtures for parser-level boundaries.
- Every supported built-in registry entry and known unsupported platform family
  must remain represented.

Malformed rows, duplicate feature names, invalid statuses, missing fixture paths,
and status/fixture mismatches are first-class tests. The matrix command is
derived from the same validated metadata used by those tests.

Matrix maintenance rules:

- Edit `tests/fixtures/conformance.tsv` first; do not hand-edit generated
  matrix output.
- Add or update fixture paths in the same change as any new supported,
  partial, or unsupported claim.
- Keep unsupported platform families represented even when they remain outside
  the executable subset.
- If the JSON matrix shape changes, refresh `tests/snapshots/matrix.json` and
  document the public contract change in release notes.
- Use `pine-compat matrix --format json` to inspect the release matrix exposed
  to consumers.

The current typed-array subset is summarized in `docs/ARRAY_STAGE_AUDIT.md`.
Keep `array.*` marked `partial` until the deferred generic, imported/non-scalar
UDT, map, broader matrix, history, and slice-aliasing semantics are designed
and fixture-backed.

The current `varip` subset is summarized in `docs/PHASE_I_AUDIT.md`. Keep
`varip` marked `partial` until drawing object ids, drawing-id arrays, tuples,
non-scalar maps, matrices, non-constructor-inferred or nested-field UDT values,
UDT arrays, imports, object arrays beyond `chart.point`, generic arrays, and
other value families have designed rollback semantics and fixture coverage.

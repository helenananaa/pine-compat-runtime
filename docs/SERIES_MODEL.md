# Series Model

This document defines how time-series values, history references, and stateful
call sites are represented.

Pine-compatible execution is not ordinary expression evaluation. The runtime
must distinguish:

- current values for the bar being evaluated
- committed historical values from previous bars
- persistent `var` storage
- state owned by built-in and user-defined function callsites

## Core Rule

```text
For each bar:
  set current built-in series values
  execute the program for the current bar
  collect side effects for the current bar
  commit current series values
```

Historical references read committed values, not mutable current locals from a
previous execution frame.

## Series Identity

A series id may belong to:

- a built-in series such as `close`
- a user variable whose value is series-qualified
- a compiler-generated temporary expression that needs history
- a function callsite with a series result
- a plot output series

The analyzer or lowering stage should assign stable ids:

```rust
struct SeriesId(u32);
struct CallSiteId(u32);
```

The runtime should not infer series identity from source text at execution time.

## Current Values

During one bar execution, the runtime maintains current values separately from
committed history:

```rust
struct Frame {
    current: ValueMap,
}
```

`x[0]` reads the current value of `x` for the current bar. `x[1]` reads the last
committed value from the series store.

## Commit

At the end of each bar:

- series-qualified variables commit their current value
- series-qualified built-in values are already known for the bar and commit
- stateful callsite outputs commit when their result is series-qualified
- plot series commit the value emitted for that bar

If a declaration site is not reached on a bar, the implementation must define
whether its current value is `na` or whether the previous current value carries.
Phase 1 should avoid unsupported ambiguous cases by rejecting scripts that rely
on conditionally skipped series declarations until this behavior is specified
and tested.

## History References

History reference syntax:

```pine
expr[offset]
```

Initial rules:

- `offset == 0` reads the current value.
- `offset > 0` reads committed history.
- out-of-range history returns `na`.
- negative offsets are rejected.
- dynamic offsets are accepted for integer expressions at any implemented
  qualifier, including `series int`.
- scripts with any dynamic offset use conservative full-history retention up to
  the runtime cap.
- `indicator(..., max_bars_back=N)` bounds dynamic history retention when `N`
  is a non-negative constant integer.

The lowering stage should determine whether `expr` needs a compiler-generated
series id. For example:

```pine
(close + open)[1]
ta.sma(close, 20)[1]
```

Both expressions need stable storage if accepted.

The current implementation boundary is tracked in
`docs/HISTORY_SERIES_AUDIT.md`.

## Callsite State

Many built-ins need state per syntactic callsite:

```pine
a = ta.ema(close, 20)
b = ta.ema(close, 20)
```

`a` and `b` have two distinct callsites. Their state must be separate even when
their arguments are textually identical.

`ta.ema` initializes from the mean of its first `length` non-na samples on
executed bars. Repeated evaluations of the same EMA or SMA callsite in one bar
replace that bar's tentative sample; they do not append additional historical
samples. EMA recalculates from its previous committed value on each such call.
A final na EMA input discards a preceding tentative sample for that bar while
preserving committed history. SMA retains its documented window-na policy.
Conditional non-execution does not advance either callsite. Different
callsites and requested runtimes remain independent.

The replacement window retains only its evicted elements and exact previous
aggregates for undo, not a full window copy per call. Existing forming-bar and
strategy-evaluation checkpoints include this state. Profile window value and
capacity totals include the undo buffer. This qualification is specific to
SMA/EMA; other stateful built-ins are not upgraded by inference.

Stateful built-ins include, at minimum:

- `ta.ema`
- `ta.rma`
- `ta.rsi`
- `ta.atr`
- rolling window functions such as `ta.sma`, `ta.bb`, `ta.stdev`,
  `ta.variance`, `ta.range`, `ta.dev`, `ta.vwma`, `ta.wma`, `ta.hma`,
  `ta.highest`, and `ta.lowest`

The initial implementation may compute some built-ins from committed history for
simplicity, but the public behavior must match the callsite-state model.

## Conditional Calls

Conditional calls are a compatibility hazard:

```pine
x = close > open ? ta.ema(close, 20) : na
```

Before supporting them broadly, define whether the callsite advances state only
when executed or whether the analyzer should require stateful series calls to be
evaluated on every bar. Phase 1 may reject stateful calls in conditional or
looped execution contexts with a clear diagnostic.

## Persistent State

`var` state is keyed by declaration site, not by variable name:

```rust
struct VarSlotId(u32);
```

This distinction matters once local scopes and functions are supported. A `var`
inside a function must have storage behavior defined per declaration site and
callsite.

## Buffer Sizing

The runtime commits values into per-series history buffers only when the HIR
history metadata says a later bar can read them. It reports `seriesValues`,
`seriesCapacity`, `maxSeriesDepth`, `historyRetentionMode`,
`historyMaxConstantOffset`, and `historyHasDynamicOffsets` in the storage
profile. A runtime cap prevents unbounded series history growth; hitting it
fails execution with a runtime error instead of silently truncating history.

HIR lowering records static history metadata:

- program-wide maximum constant history offset
- whether any supported dynamic offset exists
- per-series maximum constant history offset
- per-series dynamic-offset presence
- implicit one-bar requirements for `ta.tr`, `ta.atr`, and `ta.cross*`
- implicit `ta.change` requirements based on its length argument when constant

When no dynamic offsets exist, the runtime trims each series buffer to that
series' maximum constant offset and stores no committed history for series that
are never history-indexed. When any dynamic offset exists, retention remains
conservative and keeps full committed series history up to the runtime cap. A
declared `max_bars_back` bounds retained history for dynamic scripts and is
reported as `maxBarsBack`. The profile also reports `staticTrimmed` and
`dynamicFull`.

Later phases should add:

- configurable memory limits and diagnostics for excessive history

## Realtime Preview

Realtime execution adds a second layer:

- forming bar updates
- rollback to last committed state
- `varip`
- intrabar side effects

Historical execution should be completed first. Realtime-only features must be
rejected or explicitly marked approximate until rollback semantics are tested.

# Semantic Model

This document defines the language semantics that must be stable before the
runtime grows broad compatibility.

The first implementation should prefer a small, explicit semantic model over a
large set of partially compatible behaviors.

## Value Kinds

Initial value kinds:

- `int`
- `float`
- `bool`
- `string`
- `color`
- `plot`
- `hline`
- `na`
- `void`

`na` is a real runtime value, but it should not become a universal static type
that erases useful diagnostics. The analyzer may use an internal "unknown due to
na" marker while it waits for contextual type information.

## Versioned Legacy Indicator Semantics

Pine v1-v4 compatibility is selected from the validated source version before
ordinary semantic analysis. A missing directive is implicit v1. The legacy
front-end admits only indicator-mode `study(...)` in the documented subset;
`strategy(...)` and `strategy.*` stop before broker-capable HIR. User and
lexical symbols visible at the call's source position resolve before
version-ranged fallback names. Pine v1/v2 retain their separately bounded
forward-reference rules; from v3 onward, a later global declaration does not
retroactively shadow a fallback call inside an earlier UDF body.

Before semantic selection, the lexer has one source-origin compatibility
exception for published no-directive v1 indicators: at global scope, exactly
four ASCII spaces are treated as layout-free only when a physical line break is
adjacent to ternary `?` or `:` punctuation. This recognizes both suffix-operator
and prefix-operator ternary wrapping without turning ordinary four-space
indentation into a continuation. Any explicit version directive, tab
indentation, local-block shape, or non-ternary multiple-of-four wrap retains
structural layout and the ordinary parse failure.

Accepted historical calls are bound by dialect and lower to canonical HIR.
Exact aliases become canonical built-in names, v1/v2 removed scalar
conversions—including bool arithmetic and bool-versus-numeric
comparisons—become explicit `float`/`bool` calls, `offset` becomes a history
node, and the v1/v2 self/forward declaration subset becomes ordinary symbols in
a bounded topological order. Result-affecting decisions are recorded as legacy
translations or emulations with original spans. The runtime therefore does not
evaluate rewritten source or maintain a second legacy AST.

The v1/v2 declaration graph is capped at 256 active nodes and 4096 edges.
Symbols that require self/forward resolution are predeclared only when needed
and admit only side-effect-free scalar initializers. An earlier declaration
used solely as a source-order scalar-inference prerequisite remains an ordinary
declaration, so a preceding `input()` can feed a later self-history chain
without being predeclared or moved. Current-bar forward reordering cannot cross
such an input, request, output, mutation, or other unsafe-initializer barrier.
Pine v3 untyped `na` infers one later stable scalar type in the focused subset.
Pine v4 historical input/output and overload roles are bound before canonical
validation. Shapes outside these rules fail with focused diagnostics and
produce no HIR.

Pine v4/v5 output calls have one explicit qualifier exception: `plot`,
`plotchar`, `plotshape`, `plotarrow`, `bgcolor`, and `barcolor` may receive a
`series int` `offset`. The HIR retains the series expression, and output
metadata is overwritten on each execution so the final evaluated offset
applies to the complete rendered output. Pine v3 and v6 keep the canonical
simple-int boundary. History-reference offsets use their separate guarded
history model and are unaffected.

`plot` `style` uses the drawing-enum domain proof rather than a const-string
bound. Immutable aliases, complete conditional branches, and explicit
`input.string` options are accepted when every value is a supported
`plot.style_*` constant; unbounded strings remain errors. The HIR keeps the
series expression, and the single public `style` field is overwritten on each
bar so the last evaluated enum is the rendered metadata. `plotshape` `style`
and `hline` `linestyle` follow the same proof; plotshape records a per-bar
style series. Pine v1-v4 still accept documented style constants and input
integer ordinals.

Legacy `security` dependency admission is also versioned rather than a general
scope relaxation. Pine v4 requests written directly in an inlined UDF body may
use scalar parameters and normal immutable scalar locals. Lowered declaration
initializers retain unique symbols; the request runtime reconstructs that
admitted graph, recomputes series nodes in the requested context, and captures
const/input/simple nodes. A prior three-positional-argument legacy request can
appear in the graph only when its symbol, timeframe, gaps, and lookahead match
the enclosing request. Control-flow-local requests, different selectors,
reassignment, persistence, recursion, and modern provider-local aliases do not
enter this path.

## Script Declarations

A script may have at most one top-level declaration call. `indicator(...)`
selects indicator mode and `strategy(...)` selects strategy mode. Phase G
accepts `strategy(...)` with the common declaration metadata subset plus
positive const numeric `initial_capital` and the explicit no-conversion
`currency=currency.NONE` or same-symbol `currency=currency.USD` subset. Phase L adds the fixed default
quantity declaration subset:
`default_qty_type=strategy.fixed, default_qty_value=N` with positive const
numeric `N`. Stage 7 Slice 31 adds
`default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value=N` with positive
const numeric `N`; omitted supported entry quantities resolve at placement time
from current supported equity and current close.
`strategy.default_entry_qty(fill_price)` is a pure strategy-mode `series float`
helper over those same fixed, cash, and percent-of-equity sizing paths. It
returns the configured fixed units, cash divided by `fill_price`, or the
configured percentage of current supported equity divided by `fill_price`,
without placing an order or adding position-reversal quantity. Direct, named,
UDF, and history reads are supported. Price-dependent modes return `na` for a
non-positive or non-finite price, and percent sizing also returns `na` for
non-positive or non-finite supported equity. Indicator and requested-context
use remain rejected, and no public result field is added. Currency conversion,
symbol point value, precision, and lot-step handling remain outside the current
default-quantity contract.
Under the default or explicit `currency.NONE` account-currency path, and under
explicit `currency.USD` when it matches the current symbol currency,
`strategy.convert_to_account(value)` and `strategy.convert_to_symbol(value)` are
pure strategy-mode `series float` identities. Both accept a series/simple
numeric value, coerce integers to floats, preserve typed `na`, and support
direct, named, UDF, and history calls. Indicator and requested-context use are
rejected. Cross-currency conversion remains outside the current contract, and
neither helper adds a public result field.
Stage 7 Slices 17, 18, and 21
add supported commission declaration subsets:
`commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_contract, commission_value=N` and
`commission_type=strategy.commission.cash_per_order, commission_value=N` with
finite non-negative const numeric `N`, plus
`commission_type=strategy.commission.percent, commission_value=N` where
supported fills debit `qty * fill_price * N / 100`. Stage 7 Slice 19 adds `slippage=N` with
finite non-negative integer const ticks using the fixed `syminfo.mintick`
subset. Stage 7 Slice 20 adds `backtest_fill_limits_assumption=N` with finite
non-negative integer const ticks for supported limit-order verification.
`strategy.entry(id, strategy.long, qty=...)` is a strategy-mode side effect;
`qty` may be omitted when a supported fixed, cash, or percent-of-equity default
quantity subset is configured. Cash default quantities resolve as cash divided
by current close under the current no-currency-conversion boundary, and explicit
`qty` overrides the declaration default. The supported market-long entry creates
an internal pending entry, emits no public order while pending, and fills at the
next historical bar open before script statements on that fill bar.
`strategy.entry(..., limit=price)` creates an internal pending long limit entry,
emits no public order while pending, never fills on its creation bar, and fills
at the limit price before script statements on a later historical bar when
`low <= limit`, or below the configured verified limit threshold.
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, limit=price)` creates an internal pending
short limit entry while flat or already short, emits no public order while
pending, never fills on its creation bar, and fills at the limit price before
script statements on a later historical bar when `high >= limit`, or above the
configured verified limit threshold.
`strategy.entry(..., stop=price)` creates an internal pending
long stop entry, emits no public order while pending, never fills on its
creation bar, and fills at the stop price before script statements on a later
historical bar when `high >= stop`.
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, stop=price)` creates an internal pending
short stop entry while flat or already short, emits no public order while
pending, never fills on its creation bar, and fills at the stop price before
script statements on a later historical bar when `low <= stop`.
`strategy.entry(..., stop=price,
limit=price)` creates an internal pending long stop-limit entry, activates an
internal limit order before script statements on a later historical bar when
`high >= stop`, does not fill on that activation bar, and fills at the limit
price before script statements on a later historical bar when `low <= limit`.
`strategy.entry(..., strategy.short, stop=price, limit=price)` creates an
internal pending short stop-limit entry while flat or already short, activates
an internal limit order before script statements on a later historical bar when
`low <= stop`, does not fill on that activation bar, and fills at the limit
price before script statements on a later historical bar when `high >= limit`,
or above the configured verified limit threshold.
Same-calculation absolute `strategy.exit` attachment may target the active
pending market, limit, stop, or stop-limit entry id.
`strategy.close(id)` closes the full matching long position at the current bar
close. `strategy.close(id, qty=...)` and
`strategy.close(id, qty_percent=...)` can close part of the matching current
long position; both quantity forms must be finite and positive, fixed `qty` wins
when both forms are supplied, and oversized quantities clamp to the current
matching position size.
`strategy.close_all()` closes the current supported long position at the current
bar close without requiring an entry id; while flat or already closed it is a
no-op. It cancels pending exits for the closed entry and keeps the existing
public strategy output shape.
`strategy.cancel(id)` cancels matching internal pending entry ids and matching
pending exit ids in the supported order subset. Filled ids, unknown ids, and
already-cancelled ids are no-op, and cancellation does not expose public
pending-order records.
`strategy.cancel_all()` cancels all currently supported internal pending entries
and pending exits. Calling it without pending orders is a no-op and does not
expose public pending-order or cancellation records.
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, stop=price)`,
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, limit=price)`,
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, profit=ticks)`, and
`strategy.exit(id, from_entry, loss=ticks)` support the current long
full-position single-trigger exit subset. Stage 14f also supports market-short
single-trigger `stop=price` and `limit=price` covers against a matching open or
pending short entry; short stop fills when `high >= stop`, short limit fills
when `low <= limit` minus the configured verification offset, and Stage 14g
converts short `profit`/`loss` ticks from the matching short entry price.
Stage 14h supports short `stop+limit`, `stop+profit`, `loss+limit`, and
`loss+profit` brackets. Stage 14i supports short `trail_price`/`trail_points`
trailing covers that activate on `low`, ratchet downward, and fill on `high`. Phase R also supports exactly one
downside leg plus one upside leg in a single bracket:
`stop + limit`, `stop + profit`, `loss + limit`, and `loss + profit`. Supported
single-trigger, bracket, and trailing exits with explicit fixed `qty` or
`qty_percent` can keep multiple pending exits for different `id + from_entry`
identities on the current matching long entry. Same-calculation absolute `stop`,
`limit`, and `trail_price` attachment may target the active pending entry id;
`profit`, `loss`, and `trail_points` attachment to a pending entry remains
unsupported until deferred price resolution is designed. Their reserved
quantities are resolved at placement time, the sum of reservations is clamped to
the current open position or matching pending entry quantity, and new
zero-reservation placements are rejected without changing existing pending
exits. Same-identity calls replace the existing pending exit.
New or replaced exits ignore same-bar triggers and can fill on a later
historical bar when `low <= stop/loss price` or `high >= limit/profit price`.
Same-side touched exits fill in placement order. If downside stop/loss and
upside limit/profit candidates are both touched on the same eligible historical
bar, only downside candidates fill on that bar in placement order; opposite-side
candidates remain pending if a long position remains. If both bracket legs are
touched on the same eligible historical bar, the downside stop/loss leg fills
first. Profit and loss use positive tick distances converted from
`strategy.position_avg_price` with the fixed default `syminfo.mintick`. Phase S
also supports exactly two
trailing forms for the current side-aware broker: `trail_price + trail_offset`
and `trail_points + trail_offset`. `trail_price` is an explicit activation
price, `trail_points` converts once from `strategy.position_avg_price`, and
`trail_offset` converts once to a fixed price distance using the same fixed
default `syminfo.mintick`; trailing exits activate on a later eligible bar,
never fill on the activation bar, ratchet upward only, and later fill when
`low <= active trailing stop`. Phase U accepts optional fixed `qty` on each of
those supported single-trigger, bracket, and trailing forms. Phase V accepts
optional `qty_percent` on the same supported trigger forms. Stage 4 accepts
`qty` and `qty_percent` together on those same supported trigger forms, with
fixed `qty` determining the reserved or filled quantity. Quantity forms evaluate
once at placement time after `id` and `from_entry`, must be finite and positive,
and store an absolute requested close quantity on the pending exit. When only
`qty_percent` is used, it resolves against the current open position size, or
the matching pending entry quantity for same-calculation absolute attachment, as
`target_quantity * qty_percent / 100.0`; values above 100 are allowed because
the fill closes no more than the current position. Omitted `qty` and omitted
`qty_percent` preserve full-position one-effective-pending behavior across
supported single-trigger, bracket, and trailing forms. Different identities
replace rather than append omitted full-position pending exits, and a later
omitted full-position exit clears earlier explicit reservations for the current
matching long entry. Filled exits close
`min(requested_quantity, current position size)`, leave any remaining long
position open at the same average price, record one order event and one closed
trade for the filled quantity, and clear the pending exit. These calls are
rejected in indicator scripts and user-defined functions. Short entries,
`strategy.exit` same-side pairs, 3+ trigger or invalid trailing combinations,
multiple pending exits outside explicit fixed `qty` or `qty_percent`
single-trigger/bracket/trailing exits, omitted-quantity multiple
reservations, reservation behavior outside that subset,
unmatched missing-entry pre-placement, entry-relative exit attachment to pending
entries, `strategy.order`, broker settings beyond
`initial_capital`, fixed default quantity, supported cash commission, and
fixed-tick slippage and limit verification,
realtime strategy handoff, and
strategy metrics beyond the Phase L position/profit/equity variables remain
unsupported except for the Phase O `strategy.closedtrades` and
`strategy.opentrades` count variables, the Stage 3 outcome count variables, the
Stage 7 script-visible trade field functions, and the gross profit/loss,
profit-percent, average-trade, max run-up/drawdown, and buy-and-hold return
variables.
`strategy.initial_capital` is a read-only strategy-mode `series float` that
returns the configured or default broker starting capital on every bar. It is
available through ordinary series expressions, UDF arguments, and history
references, while indicator use, requested-context use, and mutation remain
rejected.
`strategy.account_currency` is a read-only strategy-mode `simple string`. In
the current no-conversion subset it inherits the fixed
`syminfo.currency` value, currently `"USD"`. Simple-string consumers plus
direct, UDF, and history reads are supported; const-string consumers,
indicator use, requested-context use, and mutation remain rejected. Explicit
`strategy(..., currency=currency.NONE)` and
`strategy(..., currency=currency.USD)` are accepted as the same-currency
identity path; other currency values, settings overrides, and cross-currency
conversion remain unsupported. The default same-currency conversion helpers are
described above, and no public result field is added.
`strategy.position_entry_name` is a read-only strategy-mode `series string`
that is `na` while flat and otherwise returns the entry order ID that initially
opened the current continuous net long position. A pyramiding addition or a
partial close of the initial allocation does not replace the name; the broker
clears it only when the net position becomes flat, after which a later position
can establish a new name. Direct, UDF, and history reads are supported, while
indicator use, requested-context use, and mutation remain rejected. It does
not expand the public strategy-result schema.
`strategy.openprofit_percent` is a read-only strategy-mode `series float` that
returns `strategy.openprofit / (strategy.initial_capital +
strategy.netprofit) * 100`. Direct, UDF, and history reads are supported; a
non-positive or non-finite realized-equity denominator produces `na`.
`strategy.grossprofit` is a read-only strategy-mode `series float` that sums
positive realized closed-trade profit only; losing, flat, and current open
trades do not change it. `strategy.netprofit_percent`,
`strategy.grossprofit_percent`, and `strategy.grossloss_percent` divide the
corresponding realized amount by `initial_capital` and multiply by 100.
`strategy.avg_trade_percent`, `strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent`, and
`strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent` average per-closed-trade percentage
profit/loss values, using each closed trade's entry price times quantity as the
denominator; the losing variant returns positive loss percentages.
`strategy.max_contracts_held_all`, `strategy.max_contracts_held_long`, and
`strategy.max_contracts_held_short` report the maximum
contracts/shares/lots/units held over the whole trading range. In the current
subset, `long` tracks the maximum filled long-entry quantity, `short` tracks
the maximum filled market short-entry quantity, and `all` is the max of those
two values.
`strategy.grossloss` is a read-only strategy-mode
`series float` that sums realized closed-trade losses as positive values;
winning, flat, and current open trades do not change it. `strategy.avg_trade`
is a read-only strategy-mode `series float` that returns average realized
profit/loss per closed trade and `na` before the first closed trade.
`strategy.buy_and_hold_return_percent` is a read-only strategy-mode
`series float` that returns the current close's percentage change from the
first loaded bar close and returns `na` when that baseline is zero or
non-finite.
`strategy.avg_winning_trade` is a read-only strategy-mode `series float` that
returns average realized profit among winning closed trades only and `na`
before the first winning closed trade. `strategy.avg_losing_trade` is a
read-only strategy-mode `series float` that returns average realized loss among
losing closed trades only as a positive value and `na` before the first losing
closed trade. `strategy.max_runup` is a read-only strategy-mode `series float`
that returns the maximum intrabar equity run-up amount over the current
supported long-only trading interval, using the supported entry equity, the
minimum equity before that entry, and the highest high reached while the
supported position is open. `strategy.max_runup_percent` divides the supported
run-up amount by entry price times current supported position quantity and
multiplies by 100.
`strategy.max_drawdown` is a read-only strategy-mode
`series float` that returns the maximum intrabar equity drawdown amount over
the current supported trading interval, using the supported entry equity, the
maximum equity before that entry, and the lowest low reached while the
supported position is open. `strategy.max_drawdown_percent` divides the
supported drawdown amount by entry price times current supported position
quantity and multiplies by 100. The indexed closed/open trade field families
also support `profit_percent`, `max_runup_percent`, and
`max_drawdown_percent`, each dividing the selected trade amount by its entry
price times absolute quantity and multiplying by 100. These integer strategy
variables are read-only strategy-mode `series int` values for the current
long-only broker:
`strategy.closedtrades` counts closed trades recorded by broker state;
`strategy.closedtrades.first_index` remains `0` because the local broker keeps
all closed trades and does not advance an oldest-retained-trade offset;
`strategy.wintrades`, `strategy.losstrades`, and `strategy.eventrades` count
closed trades with positive, negative, and zero realized profit; and
`strategy.opentrades` is `1` while the supported long position is open and `0`
when flat. The supported closed-trade namespace functions are
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_price`, `strategy.closedtrades.entry_id`,
`strategy.closedtrades.exit_price`, `strategy.closedtrades.exit_id`,
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index`, `strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index`,
`strategy.closedtrades.entry_time`, `strategy.closedtrades.exit_time`,
`strategy.closedtrades.commission`,
`strategy.closedtrades.size`, `strategy.closedtrades.profit`,
`strategy.closedtrades.profit_percent`, `strategy.closedtrades.max_runup`,
`strategy.closedtrades.max_runup_percent`,
`strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown`, and
`strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown_percent`;
they accept a zero-based integer `trade_num` and return `na` for missing,
negative, out-of-range, or non-integer indexes. `commission` returns `0.0`
without configured commission or supported entry-plus-exit commission when
configured. `max_runup` returns the largest
high-based favorable excursion retained for the closed trade quantity.
`max_drawdown` returns the largest low-based adverse excursion retained for the
closed trade quantity. `entry_id` returns the retained entry id, and `exit_id`
returns the retained close or exit id. Other trade details and
open-trade namespace functions remain unsupported except for
`strategy.opentrades.entry_price`, which returns the current supported long
position's entry price for `trade_num == 0`,
`strategy.opentrades.entry_id`, which returns its retained entry id, and
`strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index`, which returns its entry fill bar, and
`strategy.opentrades.entry_time`, which returns its entry fill timestamp, and
`strategy.opentrades.size`, which returns the current open position size, and
`strategy.opentrades.profit`, which returns the current close-based floating
profit for that open position, `strategy.opentrades.profit_percent`, which
divides that amount by the selected entry value, and
`strategy.opentrades.commission`, which
returns `0.0` without configured commission or the current open supported entry
commission when configured, and
`strategy.opentrades.max_runup`, which returns the largest high-based favorable
excursion seen so far for that open position,
`strategy.opentrades.max_runup_percent`, which returns that excursion relative
to entry value,
`strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown`, which returns the largest low-based adverse
excursion seen so far for that open position, and
`strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown_percent`, which returns that excursion
relative to entry value. All field functions return `na`
when flat or invalid. `strategy.opentrades.capital_held` is a read-only
strategy-mode variable and returns `na` in the current no-margin subset. With
explicit active `margin_long`, the current long-only subset returns `0.0` while
flat and current open long market value times `margin_long / 100` while open.
The same active `margin_long` setting also constrains supported long entry
fills at their actual fill price and supports the first long-only forced
liquidation subset. After a margin call, `capital_held` reflects the remaining
open long position. Explicit active `margin_short` returns absolute short
market value times `margin_short / 100` while a supported short position is
open and constrains supported short entry fills at their actual fill price.
Short forced liquidation uses `bar.high` and updates `capital_held` for the
remaining short. `strategy.margin_liquidation_price` returns the solved short
margin crossing price for active `margin_short` exposure.
Phase M and
Phase N keep pending-order records, partial fill fields, and exit reason fields
outside the public output model, and Phases R, S, U, V, W, X, and Y keep that
public contract unchanged for brackets, trailing exits, fixed `qty` exits,
percent `qty_percent` exits, and explicit fixed-quantity or percent-quantity
single-trigger/bracket/trailing reservations. Phase Z keeps the same public
contract unchanged for omitted-quantity replacement boundaries.
Diagnostics should describe the current strategy subset, not old phase names.

`indicator(...)` and `strategy(...)` declarations are mutually exclusive and
must be top-level. Declaration calls inside functions or local blocks are
semantic errors.

## Qualifiers

Qualifiers describe how a value changes over execution:

```text
const < input < simple < series
```

Promotion rule:

```text
The result qualifier of an expression is the strongest qualifier among the
operands and the called function's declared behavior.
```

Examples:

```pine
1 + 2              // const int
input(20)          // input int
input.int(20) + 1  // input int
input.string("S")  // input string
input.time(0)      // input int
close + 1          // series float
ta.sma(close, 20)  // series float
```

The analyzer must validate function arguments against declared qualifier
constraints. A `series` argument must not be accepted where a `simple` or
`input` value is required unless that specific built-in signature allows it.

## Numeric Coercion

Initial coercion rules:

- `int` can promote to `float`.
- `float` must not silently narrow to `int`.
- Arithmetic on `int` and `float` returns `float` when either side is `float`.
- Division is versioned: Pine v1-v4 `int / int` returns `int`; Pine v5 does so
  only when both operands are `const int`; Pine v5 input/simple/series integer
  division and every Pine v6 integer division return `float`. Truncating forms
  lower through an explicit canonical `int(...)` conversion.
- Modulo requires numeric operands and should follow the selected Pine version's
  documented behavior.

The analyzer should emit diagnostics for unsupported or ambiguous coercions
instead of deferring them to runtime.

## Loops

Range `for` loops execute over inclusive integer bounds. Statement-form
`for...in` loops are fixture-backed for `array<int>`, `array<float>`,
`array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`, drawing-id object arrays,
`array<chart.point>`, and same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array
values:

```pine
for value in values
    statement
```

The narrow index/value form is fixture-backed for `array<int>`, `array<float>`,
`array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`, `array<label>`, `array<line>`,
`array<linefill>`, `array<polyline>`, `array<box>`, `array<table>`,
`array<chart.point>`, and same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays
only. The index loop-local is a zero-based `series int` for the current visited
slot:

```pine
for index, value in values
    statement
```

The iterable is evaluated once before the loop starts. Runtime snapshots the
initial array length, visits indexes from `0` to `initial_len - 1`, reads each
element when that index is reached, and assigns the element by value to the
loop-local variable. `break` and `continue` use the same nearest-loop
control-flow rules as range `for` and `while`; loop-body local declarations are
scoped to the loop body; stateful built-in calls in the body advance at each
reached iteration for that callsite. Empty arrays and typed `na` array iterables
execute zero iterations. Mutating the iterated array through any
alias affects not-yet-visited existing indexes, appends do not extend the
current loop, and shrinkage that makes a future initial index out-of-bounds
raises the same runtime error as `array.get`. Label, line, linefill, polyline,
box, and table array loop values are shallow-copied ids, so drawing setters or
lifecycle operations through the loop local mutate the same drawing object while
assignment to the loop local does not write the source array slot. Chart-point
array and same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array loop values are
copied into the loop-local variable, so local field mutation does not write back
to the source slot. Expression-form `for value in values` supports only `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`,
`array<label>`, `array<line>`, `array<linefill>`, `array<polyline>`,
`array<box>`, `array<table>`, `array<chart.point>`, and same-local
scalar-tree UDT array iterables, plus runtime-owned matrix row iterables, in
the current subset. Matrix expression-form iteration binds the loop value to an
independent row snapshot array. The optional expression-form index local is the
same zero-based `series int` slot number used by statement-form index/value
iteration. It returns the last expression from the last
completed iteration, returns `na` for empty arrays, empty matrices, or typed
`na` iterables, returns the previous completed result on `break`, and skips the
current result expression on `continue`. Index/value iteration over iterables
other than `array<int>`,
`array<float>`, `array<bool>`, `array<string>`, `array<color>`,
`array<label>`, `array<line>`, `array<linefill>`, `array<polyline>`,
`array<box>`, `array<table>`, `array<chart.point>`, same-local or same-imported
scalar-tree UDT arrays, runtime-owned matrix rows, or scalar maps,
expression-form `for...in` beyond the scalar-array, drawing-id-array,
chart.point-array, same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT-array, matrix-row,
and scalar-map subset, non-array/non-matrix/non-map iterables, non-scalar-tree
UDT arrays, other non-scalar arrays, and broader collection mutation families
remain outside the current subset.
Ordinary
`var` scalar arrays roll back loop-body mutation during repeated forming
realtime updates, while scalar typed-array
`varip` iteration preserves carried intrabar loop-body mutation between repeated
forming updates. The scalar-array, label-array, line-array, linefill-array,
polyline-array, box-array, and table-array shallow-id fixtures, chart-point-array
value-copy fixture, and UDT-array value-copy fixture have explicit incremental
append execution parity with full historical recomputation.
Inside a local UDF or typed local user method, `for...in` over a same-local
scalar-tree UDT-array parameter gives each value loop local the concrete
element identity resolved for that call. Value-only and index/value statement
loops, block-local aliases of the parameter, and final expression-form loops
returning a UDT field/scalar result, the UDT element itself, or a same-identity
UDT array rebuilt from that element are supported. Named method arguments and
interleaved A-to-B-to-A calls preserve their own field layouts, returned
element identities, and rebuilt array identities.

`while` supports statement loops and a scalar expression subset:

```pine
while condition
    statement
```

The condition must be `bool`. The loop body has its own local scope, and
`break`/`continue` use the same nearest-loop control-flow rules as `for`.
`while` expressions must have a final body expression. Scalar, tuple,
same-local UDT, scalar-array, and runtime-owned matrix result subsets return
the latest reached final body expression, or `na` if no iteration produces a
value. Callers may read or mutate a returned scalar array or returned
`matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`, `matrix<string>`, or
`matrix<color>` id with supported APIs, including fresh arrays/matrices,
existing scalar-array or matrix aliases, zero-iteration `na`, break/continue
result preservation, and fresh historical copies from committed history reads.
Stateful callsites in a reached expression-loop body advance on each reached
iteration, and body-local declarations including local `var` declaration sites
follow the same loop-local storage rules as statement bodies. Nested collection
interactions through while-expression results remain outside the current subset,
with nested-array and imported UDT constructor result expressions rejected
during semantic analysis even though top-level scalar-tree imported UDT
constructors are supported.
Bodies without a final result expression remain rejected until explicit
semantics are fixture-backed.
Runtime execution enforces an iteration guard; the semantic analyzer does not
try to prove termination.

## Operators

Arithmetic operators:

```text
+ unary plus
- unary minus
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo
```

Comparison operators:

```text
== != > >= < <=
```

Logical operators:

```text
and or not
```

Conditional operator:

```text
condition ? true_expr : false_expr
```

The ternary result kind should be the least common compatible kind of both
branches. Its qualifier should be the strongest qualifier among the condition
and both branch expressions.

Switch expressions:

```pine
value = switch
    close > open => high
    close < open => low
    => close

value = switch direction
    1 => high
    -1 => low
    => close

value = switch
    close > open =>
        local = high
        local
    => close

switch direction
    1 =>
        total := total + high
    =>
        total := total + low
```

The current executable subset supports expression arms in condition and selector
forms, plus expression statement-block arms that end with a result expression.
Statement-context switch block arms can execute selected condition, selector,
and default arms for side effects, outer reassignment, and loop control without
requiring a final result expression. Selector-less arm conditions must be
`bool`. Selector-form cases are compared with equality in source order. Arm
result kinds must have a common compatible kind for expression-context switches,
following the same branch merge rules as ternary expressions. The result
qualifier is the strongest qualifier among the selector or conditions and the
selected result expressions. Same-imported-identity UDT constructor or
block-local alias results are supported for expression statement-block arms;
local/imported identity mismatches remain rejected during semantic analysis.

## Arrays

The current array subset supports float, int, bool, string, color, label-id,
line-id, linefill-id, polyline-id, box-id, table-id, and chart-point arrays:

```pine
var values = array.new_float()
array.push(values, close)
values.push(close)
first = array.get(values, 0)
same = values.get(0)
count = array.size(values)

var counts = array.new_int()
counts.push(bar_index)

var flags = array.new_bool()
flags.push(close > open)

var names = array.new_string()
names.push("seed")

var shades = array.new_color()
shades.push(color.red)

var labels = array.new_label()
labels.push(label.new(bar_index, high, "label"))

var lines = array.new_line()
lines.push(line.new(bar_index, low, bar_index + 1, high))

var fills = array.new_linefill()
fills.push(linefill.new(lines.get(0), line.new(bar_index, high, bar_index + 1, low), color.blue))

var boxes = array.new_box()
boxes.push(box.new(bar_index, high, bar_index + 1, low))

var tables = array.new_table()
tables.push(table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1))
```

`array.new_float`, `array.new_int`, `array.new_bool`, `array.new_string`, and
`array.new_color` return runtime-owned scalar array ids. `array.new_label`,
`array.new_line`, `array.new_linefill`, `array.new_polyline`, `array.new_box`,
and `array.new_table` return runtime-owned drawing-id arrays with `na` as the
default initial value.
The supported scalar and drawing-id array constructors can also be written with
official `array.new<type>` syntax for float, int, bool, string, color, label,
line, linefill, polyline, box, and table. `array.new<chart.point>` returns a
runtime-owned chart-point array id. `array.from` allocates a runtime-owned array
id with an element kind inferred from its arguments; at
least one non-`na` supported typed value is required, `na` may be mixed into an
otherwise typed array, mixed int/float arguments produce a float array, and
label, line, linefill, polyline, box, or table ids infer the matching drawing-id
array.
Normal declarations allocate a fresh array whenever the declaration executes.
`var` declarations preserve the array id and backing storage across bars.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays may be declared with `array<T>` or `T[]`
when initialized with `na` or a same-UDT array expression; the declaration keeps
the concrete local UDT identity for later assignment and helper checks.
Same-local and same-imported scalar-tree UDT array identities also flow through
ternary, `if`, `switch`, `for`, `for...in`, and `while` results. Array/`na`
branches and block-local aliases retain the known element identity for typed or
inferred declarations, helper calls, history, and iteration; different element
identities produce an `E_BRANCH_TYPE` diagnostic instead of an unlowerable HIR.
Generic UDF lowering resolves array parameters, local flow aliases, element
helper results, and `array.from` reconstruction against the current call's UDT
identity rather than shared function-body span metadata.
Local pure UDF and user-method return analysis extends that rule to same-local
scalar-tree UDT arrays, while imported pure exported UDF and imported
user-method return analysis covers same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays. The
fixture-backed return paths include direct parameters, block-local aliases,
`array.copy`, `array.new<T>`/`array.new<alias.Type>`, `array.from`, private nested
calls, typed methods with named/reordered arguments, and final control-flow
expressions. Positional, named, and reordered arguments seed a call-local
identity environment. Imported type positions are rewritten for the active
alias, and source-aware expression metadata separates import instances, so
repeated calls over different field orders or two aliases of the same physical
library preserve the concrete A-to-B-to-A layout instead of inheriting another
call's span metadata. Mixed return identities and incompatible explicitly typed
destinations remain semantic errors. Tuple returns may contain same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays: tuple literals and UDF/method direct,
block, nested, and final-control-flow results preserve one concrete identity per
destructured slot, including typed-`na` locals and distinct UDT identities in
different slots. Tuple-valued ordinary declarations also retain their element
types and per-slot identities through direct and self aliases,
ternary/`switch` results, assigned `if` results, shadowing, and later tuple
destructuring. The first declaration fixes each UDT-array slot identity.
Same-identity or `na` reassignment preserves it, while direct or control-flow
reassignment to a different identity and unresolved nested tuple consumers
emit root-spanned `E_TUPLE_UDT_ARRAY_IDENTITY` diagnostics. Qualified
user-defined UDF/method results and unqualified plain local UDF results support
direct `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`,
`.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, and `.lastindexof(value)` dispatch for
every currently supported array kind. Concrete bool, int, or float results
additionally admit terminal `.every()`/`.some()`. Concrete numeric results additionally
admit `.binary_search(value)`, `.binary_search_leftmost(value)`,
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`, terminal
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, fresh same-kind
`.abs()` chains, and fixed-float `.standardize()` chains. Concrete int, float,
or string results additionally admit transforming `.sort_indices(order?)`;
concrete same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT results admit
`.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` for a compile-time root int/float/string
field resolved against the exact result identity.
Every concrete result additionally admits mutating, array-returning
`.concat(id2)` for a same-kind or exact-identity source. It returns the receiver
id and may continue through the closed array-result path; alias/live-slice
receivers update shared backing, fresh snapshots remain independent, and the
ordinary upstream-`na`, capacity, arity, and UDF-side-effect gates apply.
Every scalar result kind, plus concrete same-local or same-imported scalar-tree
UDT array results, additionally admits terminal `.join(separator?)` with the
ordinary array stringification and separator rules.
Every concrete array result additionally admits terminal top-level `.clear()`
and `.reverse()` mutations; both return `void`, cannot continue, and remain
rejected while analyzing a UDF body by the ordinary collection-side-effect
rule.
Terminal top-level `.pop()` additionally removes and returns the final element
with the receiver-derived scalar/object/`chart.point` kind or concrete local/
imported UDT identity. It is also a UDF-rejected mutation and cannot continue.
Terminal top-level `.shift()` has the same typing and rejection boundaries,
but removes the first element and preserves the order of the remainder.
Terminal top-level `.remove(index)` preserves that element typing for the
selected positive or in-range negative index. It requires a simple-int-
compatible index, returns `na` without mutation for explicit `na`, preserves
ordinary out-of-range runtime errors, and cannot continue.
Terminal top-level `.push(value)` preserves the receiver element kind or UDT
identity, accepts one element-compatible value, appends at the result's end,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. It shares the alias/live-window/fresh-
snapshot, upstream-`na`, UDF, and capacity boundaries.
Terminal top-level `.unshift(value)` preserves that same element kind or UDT
identity, prepends one compatible value at the result's start, returns `void`,
and cannot continue. It shares the same alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot,
upstream-`na`, UDF, and capacity boundaries.
Terminal top-level `.insert(index, value)` additionally accepts a simple-int-
compatible index, inserts at a positive, in-range negative, or end position,
returns `void`, and cannot continue. Explicit `na` indexes and upstream-`na`
results remain no-ops after value evaluation; ordinary bounds, identity,
alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, UDF, and capacity behavior is preserved.
Terminal top-level `.set(index, value)` shares the index/value and identity
contract but replaces one existing positive or in-range negative slot without
changing length. It returns `void` and cannot continue; explicit `na` indexes
and upstream-`na` receivers no-op after value evaluation, while empty/out-of-
range, alias/live-window/fresh-snapshot, and UDF behavior remains unchanged.
Terminal top-level `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)` shares the element
kind/identity contract and validates optional simple-int-compatible half-open
bounds. Omitted bounds fill the full result, live windows update parent backing,
and fresh map/matrix-derived arrays remain source-independent. It returns
`void` and cannot continue; explicit `na`, negative, reversed, oversized,
empty, and upstream-`na` cases no-op after all supplied arguments are evaluated,
while UDF mutation remains rejected.
Terminal top-level `.sort(order?, sort_field?)` mutates concrete int/float/
string results under the ordinary ascending default and const-order rules.
Same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT results require a compile-time root
int/float/string `sort_field`, lowered against their exact identity. Alias/live-
window results reorder parent backing, while fresh map/matrix-derived arrays
remain source-independent. It returns `void`, cannot continue, no-ops for empty
or upstream-`na` results after order evaluation, and retains unsupported-kind,
field/order/arity, and UDF-side-effect boundaries.
The transforming `.slice(index_from, index_to)` preserves the receiver's
element kind and concrete UDT identity and returns the ordinary shallow live
parent window, so the result may continue through the same closed helper set.
Transforming `.concat(id2)` preserves that kind/identity, appends a same-kind
source into the receiver, returns the receiver id, and may continue through the
same helper set. Alias/live-window writes reach shared parent backing, fresh
snapshots remain independent, and ordinary upstream-`na`, capacity, arity, and
UDF-side-effect behavior applies.
The parser assigns the unqualified form the impossible internal prefix
`$call_result`; the normalization requires a plain lexical callee, while
qualified user-defined forms keep their source prefix.

The separate built-in `array.*` call-result path is an exact producer allowlist:
`array.new_float`, `array.new_int`, `array.new_bool`, `array.new_string`,
`array.new_color`, `array.new_line`, `array.new_linefill`,
`array.new_polyline`, `array.new_label`, `array.new_box`, `array.new_table`,
`array.new<chart.point>`, supported `array.new<UDT>`, `array.from`,
`array.copy`, `array.slice`, `array.concat`, `array.abs`,
`array.standardize`, and `array.sort_indices`.
Supported scalar, drawing-id, `chart.point`, and concrete same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree UDT `array.new<T>` source templates use the matching
canonical constructor or checked UDT-template path. The parser marks only
those receivers with `$builtin_array_result`, and semantic analysis admits only
`.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`,
`.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, and `.lastindexof(value)`, plus
bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()` and numeric-only `.binary_search(value)`, `.binary_search_leftmost(value)`,
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`, `.abs()`, and
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)` or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)`, scalar/same-identity scalar-tree UDT `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?, sort_field?)`, after them. Only `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()` and
`.standardize()`, and sortable-scalar or exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)` produce array
receivers that may continue; the reads/searches
are terminal and cannot continue into a user method or any other call-result
method, including a method on a returned scalar UDT element. `.clear()`,
`.reverse()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.remove(index)`, `.push(value)`, `.unshift(value)`, `.insert(index, value)`, `.set(index, value)`, `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`, `.sort(order?, sort_field?)`, and `.concat(id2)` are the
twelve admitted mutations. `.clear()`, `.reverse()`, `.push(value)`,
`.unshift(value)`, `.insert(index, value)`, `.set(index, value)`, `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`, and `.sort(order?, sort_field?)` return
`void`; `.pop()`, `.shift()`, and `.remove(index)` return the removed element;
none can continue.
`array` is reserved as the built-in lexical prefix for this path; a qualified
user or import alias with that spelling cannot use call-result dispatch.

The same `$builtin_array_result` path has a second set of seven fixed producers
outside the `array` namespace: `str.split`, `ta.pivot_point_levels`, `matrix.row`,
`matrix.col`, `matrix.eigenvalues`, `map.keys`, and `map.values`. Each result
admits only `.size()`, `.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`,
`.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`,
`.includes(value)`, `.indexof(value)`, and `.lastindexof(value)`, plus
bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()` and numeric-only `.binary_search(value)`, `.binary_search_leftmost(value)`,
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`, `.abs()`, and
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)`, all-scalar terminal `.join(separator?)`, and terminal top-level `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`; only
`.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string
`.sort_indices(order?)` return array receivers eligible for another allowed
chain. The other twenty-nine value results and the eight `void` mutations are
terminal. Return
kinds stay
producer-specific: `array<string>` for `str.split`, `array<float>` for
`ta.pivot_point_levels`, the matching scalar element array for `matrix.row`
and `matrix.col` over float/int/bool/string/color matrices, `array<float>` for
`matrix.eigenvalues` over its supported numeric matrices, and the matching
scalar key/value array for `map.keys`/`map.values` when each map template side
is int, float, bool, string, or color. Matrix row/column/eigenvalue arrays and
map key/value arrays retain their existing independent snapshot semantics;
postfix copies are independent again. Empty/`na`, negative index, bounds, and
element-type checks still come from the ordinary producer and array-helper
analysis/runtime rules.

Namespace-qualified `matrix.mult(...)`, `matrix.copy(...)`,
`matrix.transpose(...)`, `matrix.submatrix(...)`, `matrix.kron(...)`,
`matrix.diff(...)`, `matrix.pow(...)`, `matrix.inv(...)`, and
`matrix.pinv(...)` plus `matrix.eigenvectors(...)` instead use the
separate `$builtin_matrix_result` synthetic prefix. `matrix.mult` semantic
dispatch is selected by the resolved `ReturnSpec::MatrixMult` result.
Matrix-by-array, array-by-matrix,
and array-by-array overloads resolve to `array<float>` and admit `.size()`,
`.get(index)`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.copy()`, `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, `.concat(id2)`, `.includes(value)`,
`.indexof(value)`, `.lastindexof(value)`, `.every()`, `.some()`, `.binary_search(value)`,
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`, `.binary_search_rightmost(value)`, and
`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.sort_indices(order?)` plus terminal `.join(separator?)`, `.clear()`, `.reverse()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.remove(index)`, `.push(value)`, `.unshift(value)`, `.insert(index, value)`, `.set(index, value)`, `.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`, and `.sort(order?)`; `.slice(...)` preserves the array-valued overload and switches to the array-result prefix.
Matrix-by-matrix,
matrix-by-scalar, and scalar-by-matrix resolve to `matrix<float>` and admit only
`.rows()`, `.columns()`, `.elements_count()`, `.get(row, column)`, and
`.copy()`, plus `.row(index)`, `.col(index)`, and numeric-only
`.eigenvalues()`, `.is_zero()`, `.is_binary()`, `.is_diagonal()`,
`.is_identity()`, `.is_symmetric()`, `.is_antisymmetric()`, and
`.is_stochastic()`, plus numeric-only terminal
`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.min()`/`.max()`/`.mode()`/`.trace()`/`.det()`/`.rank()` and
all-kind terminal `.is_square()`. Int inputs still resolve to float collection results. Matrix
`.copy()` continues on the matrix-result prefix;
`.row(index)` and `.col(index)` use `ReturnSpec::MatrixArray(0)` and switch the
parser marker to `$builtin_array_result`, producing fresh element-kind-preserving arrays
while `.eigenvalues()` retains its fixed `simple array<float>` result and
numeric-matrix parameter check. All three switch to the array-result prefix and
admit `.size()`/`.get()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/`.slice(index_from, index_to)`/`.concat(id2)`/`.includes(value)`/
`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`/`.every()`/`.some()`/`.binary_search(value)`/
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/
`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`/`.join(separator?)` terminal reads plus transforming `.standardize()` and `.sort_indices(order?)` and terminal `.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)`, with copy/slice/concat/abs/standardize/sort_indices array continuation and terminal read/search/aggregate/mutation checks.
`.is_square()` retains the ordinary `MATRIX_ANY_ID_PARAMS`
signature and `simple bool` return, accepts every supported concrete matrix
kind, and is terminal without changing the parser marker. `.is_zero()` retains
`MATRIX_NUMERIC_ID_PARAMS` and the fixed `simple bool`
return, so float/int matrix results are accepted while bool/string/color
matrix results keep the ordinary numeric-matrix diagnostic; it is terminal
without changing the parser marker. `.is_binary()` shares that numeric-matrix
signature, fixed simple-bool return, and terminal marker behavior while
retaining its ordinary strict 0-or-1 type rules. `.is_diagonal()` shares the
numeric-matrix/simple-bool terminal contract and retains the ordinary off-
diagonal-zero type rule without a square constraint.
`.is_identity()` shares the same numeric/simple-bool terminal signature while
retaining its ordinary square-shape, exact-one diagonal, and exact-zero off-
diagonal rules. `.is_symmetric()` shares the numeric/simple-bool terminal
signature and retains the ordinary square-shape and exact transposed-pair-
equality rules.
`.is_antisymmetric()` shares that numeric/simple-bool terminal signature and
retains the ordinary square-shape, exact-zero main-diagonal, and exact negated-
transposed-pair rules.
`.is_stochastic()` shares that numeric/simple-bool terminal signature and
retains the ordinary non-empty, finite, non-negative, exact-unit-row-or-column-
sum rules.
`.sum()` retains `MATRIX_NUMERIC_ID_PARAMS`, returns a fixed `series float`,
and is terminal; its ordinary runtime rules ignore `na` cells and return `na`
when no numeric cell is present or the accumulated result is non-finite.
`.avg()` shares that numeric/`series float` terminal signature, divides only by
the number of non-`na` numeric cells, and returns `na` when none exist or the
result is non-finite.
`.min()` shares the numeric/`series float` terminal signature, scans only non-
`na` numeric cells, and returns `na` when none exist or the selected minimum is
non-finite.
`.max()` shares that contract with the selected maximum.
`.mode()` shares the numeric/`series float` terminal signature, ignores `na`
cells, selects the smallest value among equally frequent repeats, and returns
`na` when no value repeats or the selected value is non-finite.
`.trace()` shares the numeric/`series float` terminal signature, sums non-`na`
main-diagonal cells over `min(rows, columns)`, and returns `na` when the
diagonal has no numeric value or the sum is non-finite.
`.det()` shares the numeric/`series float` terminal signature and retains the
ordinary runtime square-matrix error, `0 x 0 = 1.0`, singular zero, and invalid-
cell/non-finite `na` rules without adding static shape inference.
`.rank()` retains `MATRIX_NUMERIC_ID_PARAMS`, returns a fixed `series int`,
supports rectangular and singular matrices, returns `0` for zero-element
matrices, returns `na` for invalid/non-finite cells, and is terminal.
`.transpose()` retains `MATRIX_ANY_ID_PARAMS` and `SameAsArg(0)`, returns a
fresh matrix of the same element kind with swapped row/column counts, and is
non-terminal: the matrix-result prefix remains available to `.copy()`, another
`.transpose()`, or any supported matrix reader.
`.submatrix(...)` retains `MATRIX_SUBMATRIX_PARAMS` and `SameAsArg(0)`, returns
a fresh element-kind-preserving optional/default half-open range, preserves
empty row/column shapes, and is non-terminal on the same matrix-result prefix.
`.inv()` retains `MATRIX_NUMERIC_ID_PARAMS`, always returns a fixed
`simple matrix<float>`, and is non-terminal on that prefix. It keeps the
ordinary runtime square-shape boundary, empty `0 x 0` result, and singular or
invalid-cell `na` behavior without adding static shape inference.
`.pinv()` retains the same numeric signature and fixed float-matrix return,
swaps rectangular row/column counts, preserves singular matrix-valued results
and swapped zero-cell shapes, yields `na` for invalid/non-finite cells, and is
non-terminal on the same prefix.
`.eigenvectors()` also retains the numeric signature and fixed float-matrix
return. It preserves square shape for a complete real eigenvector basis,
returns empty `0 x 0`, keeps the runtime non-square error, yields `na` for
invalid/non-finite, non-real, or incomplete results, and is non-terminal on the
same prefix.
`.pow(power)` retains `MATRIX_POW_PARAMS`, including the simple-int power gate,
and returns a fixed `simple matrix<float>`. It keeps the runtime square-matrix,
negative-power, and `na`-power boundaries; identity, copy, positive-power,
empty `0 x 0`, and `na`-cell behavior stay unchanged, and the result remains
non-terminal on the same prefix.
`.kron(other)` retains `MATRIX_TWO_NUMERIC_ID_PARAMS`, including the numeric-
matrix operand gate, and returns a fixed `simple matrix<float>`. It allocates an
independent result whose row and column counts are the products of the two
source dimensions, preserves `na` cells and zero dimensions, propagates an
upstream `na`, retains the matrix cell-budget error, and is non-terminal on the
same prefix.
`.diff(other)` retains `MATRIX_MATRIX_OR_NUMERIC_PAIR_PARAMS`, including the
numeric-matrix-or-scalar operand gate, and returns a fixed
`simple matrix<float>`. It allocates an independent receiver-shaped result,
preserves left-to-right subtraction, `na` cells, `na` scalars, zero dimensions,
and upstream `na`, retains the matching-shape runtime error for matrix
operands, and is non-terminal on the same prefix.
`.mult(other)` retains `MATRIX_MULT_PARAMS`, including the numeric-matrix,
numeric-scalar, or numeric-array operand gate. Matrix operands return an
independent fixed `simple matrix<float>` with receiver rows and operand
columns, scalar operands return the same fixed matrix kind with receiver shape,
and numeric-array operands return an independent `simple array<float>` with one
value per receiver row. The semantic result type selects matrix or array
call-result helper dispatch without widening either closed set. Multiplication
order, `na` propagation, zero-inner-dimension behavior, matrix cell limits,
matrix dimension checks, and vector-length checks remain unchanged.
`.set(row, column, value)` retains `MATRIX_SET_PARAMS` and returns `void` for
every concrete matrix call-result producer. Its receiver kind determines the
element-compatible value check; row and column retain their simple-int gates.
The result is terminal. Alias-returning local UDF or user-method receivers
mutate shared storage, while fresh namespace, bound-transform, imported-
function, and imported-method results isolate the write. Upstream `na`, bounds,
and UDF side-effect rules are inherited from ordinary `matrix.set`.
`.fill(value)` likewise retains the registered matrix-fill signature and
returns terminal `void` for every concrete matrix call-result producer. It
validates the receiver's concrete element kind and preserves alias writes for
local UDF/user-method results versus isolated writes for fresh namespace,
bound-transform, imported-function, and imported-method results. Empty and
upstream-`na` no-op behavior and UDF side-effect rejection are unchanged.
`.reverse()` also returns terminal `void` for every concrete matrix call-result
producer. It reverses the row-major cell sequence without changing shape and
preserves local UDF/user-method alias writes versus isolated writes for fresh
namespace, bound-transform, imported-function, and imported-method results.
Empty/upstream-`na`, invalid arity, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
`.reshape(rows, columns)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every concrete
matrix call-result producer. It preserves row-major cells, validates simple-
int dimensions, and preserves local UDF/user-method alias shape writes versus
isolated writes for fresh producers. Negative/`na` dimensions, element-count
mismatch, upstream-`na` dimension evaluation, and UDF side-effect behavior are
unchanged.
`.swap_rows(row1, row2)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every concrete
matrix call-result producer. It validates two simple-int row indexes, swaps
complete rows while preserving shape and concrete element kind, preserves
local UDF/user-method alias writes versus isolated fresh-producer writes, and
treats equal indexes as a no-op. Bounds/`na` indexes, upstream-`na` argument
evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect behavior are unchanged.
`.swap_columns(column1, column2)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every
concrete matrix call-result producer. It validates two simple-int column
indexes, swaps complete columns while preserving shape and concrete element
kind, preserves local UDF/user-method alias writes versus isolated fresh-
producer writes, and treats equal indexes as a no-op. Bounds/`na` indexes,
upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
behavior are unchanged.
`.remove_row(row)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every concrete matrix
call-result producer. It validates one simple-int row index, removes the
selected complete row, including from a zero-column matrix, while preserving
column count and concrete element kind, and preserves local UDF/user-method
alias shape writes versus isolated fresh-producer writes. Bounds/`na` indexes,
upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
behavior are unchanged.
`.remove_col(column)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every concrete
matrix call-result producer. It validates one simple-int column index, removes
the selected complete column, including from a zero-row matrix, while
preserving row count and concrete element kind, and preserves local UDF/user-
method alias shape writes versus isolated fresh-producer writes. Bounds/`na`
indexes, upstream-`na` argument evaluation, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-
effect behavior are unchanged.
`.add_row(row, array_id)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every concrete
matrix call-result producer. It validates one simple-int insertion index and
an element-kind-matched array, copies the array into a complete new row—
including for a zero-column matrix—while preserving column count and concrete
element kind, and preserves local UDF/user-method alias shape writes versus
isolated fresh-producer writes. The index admits `0..=rows`; bounds/`na`, array-
size, cell-budget, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
behavior are unchanged.
`.add_col(column, array_id)` likewise returns terminal `void` for every
concrete matrix call-result producer. It validates one simple-int insertion
index and an element-kind-matched array, copies the array into a complete new
column—including for a zero-row matrix—while preserving row count and concrete
element kind, and preserves local UDF/user-method alias shape writes versus
isolated fresh-producer writes. The index admits `0..=columns`; bounds/`na`,
array-size, cell-budget, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, and UDF side-effect
behavior are unchanged.
Numeric `.sort(column?, order?)` likewise returns terminal `void` for concrete
float/int matrix call-result producers. It defaults to column 0 and ascending
order, reorders complete rows while preserving shape and element kind, keeps
equal-key rows stable, and places `na` last ascending and first descending.
Local UDF/user-method aliases mutate while fresh producers remain isolated.
Column bounds/`na`, unsupported-order, upstream-`na`, invalid arity/type, non-
numeric receiver, and UDF side-effect behavior retain ordinary `matrix.sort`
boundaries.
Other terminal readers, wrong-result helpers, invalid arity or argument types,
broader helpers, and mutation other than `.set(...)`/`.fill(...)`/`.reverse()`/`.reshape(...)`/`.add_row(...)`/`.add_col(...)`/`.sort(...)`/`.swap_rows(...)`/`.swap_columns(...)`/`.remove_row(...)`/`.remove_col(...)` fail closed. The
existing bound-receiver
`matrix_id.mult(array).size()` path remains on array-helper dispatch, while
exact bound matrix-valued `matrix_id.mult(other)` results share the forty-four
matrix helpers for matrix or scalar operands with the
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose/row/column/eigenvalue/predicate/aggregate-reader continuation
rules.
Unqualified local-UDF results with an inferred concrete supported matrix kind
share the same helpers through `$call_result`, preserve per-call float/int/bool/
string/color kinds, and use the same continuation rules. Concrete local or
imported user methods and registered imported functions share the row/column/
numeric-eigenvalue-array
transition plus terminal all-kind square and numeric zero/binary/diagonal/
identity/symmetric/antisymmetric/stochastic/sum/avg/min/max/mode/trace/det/rank reads; unknown/`na` and non-matrix
returns retain generic or result-family
rejection. Producer-specific “copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose-only” wording below refers only
to continuing as a matrix result. Exact namespace
`matrix.copy` always takes the matrix branch, preserves the source
float/int/bool/string/color matrix kind through `SameAsArg`, and retains
independent-copy storage semantics. Exact bound matrix-receiver
`matrix_id.copy()` results are recognized separately from user-defined
call-result prefixes, retain the concrete receiver element kind, and admit the
same seven all-kind read/copy/submatrix/transpose helpers; numeric results also
admit `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` with copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation.
Exact namespace `matrix.transpose` also takes
the matrix branch, preserves the source scalar element kind through `SameAsArg`,
swaps row/column shape, and retains independent storage. Exact bound
matrix-receiver `matrix_id.transpose()` results share the same seven all-kind
helpers, add `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results, and retain
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation after the original receiver resolves
to a supported matrix kind.
Exact namespace `matrix.submatrix` also takes the matrix branch, preserves the
source element kind through `SameAsArg`, and returns an independent half-open
range with default full bounds and empty row/column slices. Exact bound
matrix-receiver `matrix_id.submatrix(...)` results share the same seven all-
kind helpers, add `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` for numeric results, and retain
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation after the original receiver resolves
to a supported matrix kind. Exact namespace
`matrix.kron` also takes the matrix branch, resolves to fixed
`simple matrix<float>` for numeric matrix inputs, expands both dimensions, and
retains independent storage, `na`, and zero-dimension semantics. Exact bound
numeric-matrix-receiver `matrix_id.kron(other)` results share the same fourteen
read/copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation after the original receiver type check. Exact namespace
`matrix.diff` also takes the matrix branch, resolves to fixed
`simple matrix<float>` for numeric operand pairs containing a matrix, preserves
the selected matrix shape and left-to-right subtraction order, and retains
independent storage, `na`, and zero-dimension semantics. Exact bound
numeric-matrix-receiver `matrix_id.diff(other)` results share the fourteen
read/copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation after the receiver/operand checks.
Exact namespace
`matrix.pow` also takes the matrix branch, resolves to fixed
`simple matrix<float>` for numeric square matrices and simple-int powers, and
retains independent identity/copy/positive-power, `na`, and empty `0 x 0`
semantics. Exact bound `matrix_id.pow(power)` results share the fourteen matrix
helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation.
Exact namespace `matrix.inv` also takes the matrix branch, resolves to fixed
`simple matrix<float>` for numeric inputs, preserves square shape for
invertible matrices, returns an empty `0 x 0` matrix for empty input, and yields
`na` for singular or invalid-cell inputs. Exact bound `matrix_id.inv()` results
share the fourteen matrix helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation.
Exact namespace
`matrix.pinv` also takes the matrix branch,
resolves to fixed `simple matrix<float>` for numeric inputs, swaps row/column
shape for rectangular matrices, retains singular matrix-valued results and
zero-cell swapped shapes, and yields `na` for invalid-cell inputs. Exact bound
`matrix_id.pinv()` results share the fourteen matrix helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose
continuation. Exact namespace
`matrix.eigenvectors` also takes the matrix branch, resolves to fixed
`simple matrix<float>` for numeric inputs, preserves square shape for real
complete eigenvectors, returns empty `0 x 0`, and yields `na` for invalid-cell,
non-real, or incomplete results. Exact bound `matrix_id.eigenvectors()` results
share the fourteen matrix helpers and copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation. Exact
`matrix.new<float>`, `matrix.new<int>`,
`matrix.new<bool>`, `matrix.new<string>`, and `matrix.new<color>` template
results also enter this path, preserve their element kind, requested shape,
type-compatible initial or default `na` cells, fresh allocation, and copy
independence. All five kinds expose the same seven helpers, while numeric
template results additionally expose `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)`. Map templates such as
unsupported `map.new` forms, unsupported matrix templates,
every other namespace or non-producer member, and other matrix-returning calls
stay excluded. Built-in
namespace prefixes remain reserved and cannot be treated as same-named
user/import qualifiers. No UDT or imported-type identity is inferred, and
public schemas remain unchanged.

Exact supported scalar `map.new<K,V>` templates use the separate
`$builtin_map_result` synthetic prefix. The receiver retains its concrete
scalar key/value kinds and admits `.size()`, terminal `.put(key, value)`,
`.clear()`, `.remove(key)`, and `.put_all(source)`,
`.get(key)`, `.contains(key)`, `.copy()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`; only
`.copy()` may continue another admitted map helper. `.put(...)`, `.clear()`,
`.remove(...)`, and `.put_all(...)` return `void` and cannot continue. `.keys()` and `.values()` switch to the array-result prefix
and return fresh key/value-kind-preserving arrays, which admit direct binding
plus `.size()`/`.get()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/`.slice(index_from, index_to)`/`.concat(id2)`/`.includes(value)`/
`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`, bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()`, and numeric-only
`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/
`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)` and all-scalar terminal `.join(separator?)`, with copy/slice/concat/abs/standardize/sort_indices array
continuation and terminal read/search/aggregate checks. The ordinary map analyzer validates
key types and marks copy
results with the same template metadata. Exact namespace `map.copy(existing)`
results use the same prefix and retain both source template metadata and
entries through the existing independent-copy runtime operation. Map mutation
outside terminal `.put(...)`/`.clear()`/`.remove(...)`/`.put_all(...)`, unsupported templates, non-map copy inputs, and
other map call-result receivers fail closed. Unqualified local-UDF results with
one concrete supported scalar map template share the same ten helpers through
`$call_result`; parameter passthrough, block aliases, nested calls,
same-template control flow, constructed/copied results, named/reordered
arguments, empty maps, and per-call scalar key/value templates retain their
existing semantics. Registered local and imported user-function results with
one concrete supported scalar map template enter the same helper lowering;
unqualified or alias-qualified, block-return, nested-function, same-template
control-flow, constructed-result, scalar-template-interleaving, same-library
dual-alias, and independent-copy paths are preserved. Analysis-marked local
and imported user-method results retain their receiver-style and qualified/
direct-constructor paths. Only copy may continue as a map, while keys and
values continue through the closed array-result set. Terminal `.put(...)`
validates both concrete scalar kinds, preserves insertion order when replacing
an existing value, appends new keys, writes through local alias-returning UDF/
method results, and stays isolated on fresh built-in/imported producers.
Terminal `.clear()` empties the backing entry list with the same local-alias
mutation versus fresh-result isolation split.
Terminal `.remove(key)` validates the key template, deletes an existing entry
without reordering retained keys, no-ops for a missing key, and uses the same
alias/fresh split.
Terminal `.put_all(source)` requires identical templates, clones source entries
before merging for self-safety, replaces retained-key values in place, appends
new keys in source order, and uses the same alias/fresh split.
Unknown/`na`, scalar, array, matrix, wrong-template/key/value, broader helpers,
map mutation outside terminal `.put(...)`/`.clear()`/`.remove(...)`/`.put_all(...)`, call-result-array mutation other
than `.concat(id2)`, and continuation after a terminal key/value-array reader
remain gated; direct UDF mutation is still rejected. This path adds no UDT/
import identity or public schema field.

For the array-helper branch, the receiver must resolve to a supported array
kind. UDT-array producers must also carry one concrete same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree identity;
`get` retains that identity across named indexes and nested copy chains, while
`size`/`last` retain existing empty and typed-`na` behavior. Unsupported or
mixed identities, invalid producer arguments, and unknown templates fail
closed rather than falling through to a same-named method. Unqualified local
UDF results carrying a concrete local or imported scalar UDT identity may still
use the existing pure user-method dispatch, and explicit same-named local
methods and imported functions remain distinct. Other `array.*` calls,
built-in namespaces and templates outside the seven fixed producers plus the
result-type-checked namespace `matrix.mult` paths, helpers beyond the applicable
forty-four-item postfix read/copy/search/transform/aggregate/mutation set, non-array/non-
matrix/non-UDT results, unknown/`na` results without a concrete supported type
or identity, and postfix mutation other than `.concat(id2)`/`.clear()`/`.reverse()`/`.pop()`/`.shift()`/`.remove(index)`/`.push(value)`/`.unshift(value)`/`.insert(index, value)`/`.set(index, value)`/`.fill(value, index_from?, index_to?)`/`.sort(order?)` remain outside this subset. A postfix read
does not make a mutating producer pure:
`array.concat(...).size()` still mutates the first concat input and is rejected
inside UDFs. `.includes(value)` reuses the ordinary array element-kind and UDT-
identity argument checks plus structural/object equality, returns `series bool`,
returns false for an empty concrete array, propagates an upstream `na` array,
does not mutate the result, and is terminal without another parser prefix.
`.every()` accepts only concrete bool/int/float results, returns fixed `series
bool`, treats nonzero numerics and `true` as truthy, treats zero, `false`, and
element `na` as false, returns true for an empty array, propagates an upstream
`na` array, leaves the source unchanged, and is terminal. String/color/object/
chart-point/UDT results and extra arguments remain rejected.
`.some()` shares the concrete bool/int/float gate and fixed `series bool`
result, but returns true when any nonzero numeric or `true` element exists.
Zero, `false`, and element `na` do not satisfy it; empty arrays return false,
upstream `na` propagates, the source remains unchanged, and the scalar result
is terminal. The same unsupported receiver kinds and extra-arity boundary
apply.
`.join(separator?)` accepts every scalar array result and concrete same-local or
same-imported scalar-tree UDT array result. It returns fixed `series string`,
defaults an omitted or `na` separator to comma, preserves ordinary scalar,
color, and UDT formatting, returns `""` for an empty array, propagates an
upstream `na` array, leaves the source unchanged, retains the 40960-character
runtime limit, and is terminal. Object-id and `chart.point` arrays, invalid
separators, and extra arguments remain rejected.
`.indexof(value)` uses the same checks and equality, returns the first zero-
based match as `simple int`, returns `-1` for missing or empty concrete arrays
and for an upstream `na` array, does not mutate the result, and is terminal.
`.lastindexof(value)` uses the same checks and equality, returns the last zero-
based match as `simple int`, returns `-1` for missing or empty concrete arrays
and for an upstream `na` array, does not mutate the result, and is terminal.
`.binary_search(value)` is admitted only for concrete float/int result arrays
and a numeric value. It expects ascending contents and performs an exact lower-
bound search, returning the leftmost duplicate match or `-1` for missing,
empty, and upstream-`na` arrays as `simple int`; it is non-mutating and terminal.
Nonnumeric, object/chart-point, and UDT result arrays fail the numeric receiver
gate.
`.binary_search_leftmost(value)` shares that gate and ascending-input contract.
It returns the first exact duplicate index; a miss returns the nearest-left
element index, clamped to `0` below the minimum and the last index above the
maximum. Empty and upstream-`na` arrays return `-1`. The `simple int` result is
non-mutating and terminal.
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)` is the symmetric ceiling search: exact
duplicates return their last index and misses return the nearest-right element,
with the same below-min/above-max clamps, empty/upstream-`na` `-1`, numeric gate,
`simple int`, non-mutation, and terminal boundaries.
`.abs()` returns a fresh same-kind numeric array, preserves `na`, empty, and
upstream-`na` behavior, leaves its source unchanged, and may continue through
the closed array path. `.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)` return a terminal `series int`
or `series float`; they rank filtered non-`na` values in ascending order for
`min` and descending order for `max`, with a zero-based optional dynamic
integer rank that defaults to `0`. Empty/all-`na`/upstream-
`na` inputs and `na`, negative, or out-of-range ranks return `na`.
`.sum()` returns the receiver-derived terminal `series int` or `series float`,
adds filtered non-`na` values, and returns `na` for empty, all-`na`, or
upstream-`na` inputs.
`.avg()` averages the same filtered values as a terminal `series float`, shares
the empty/all-`na`/upstream-`na` boundaries, and returns `na` for a non-finite
result.
`.range()` computes filtered maximum minus minimum as the receiver-derived
terminal series numeric kind, returning `na` for empty, all-`na`, upstream-
`na`, or non-finite float differences.
`.median()` sorts filtered values and uses the middle item or middle-pair mean,
preserving the receiver-derived terminal series numeric kind. Integer pair
means truncate toward zero; empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, and non-finite
float medians return `na`.
`.mode()` selects the most frequent filtered value in the receiver-derived
terminal series numeric kind, choosing the smaller value for tied frequencies.
At least one value must repeat; empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, and all-unique
arrays return `na`.
`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)` sorts filtered values and selects the
nearest-rank element at `ceil(percentage / 100 * count) - 1`, with `0` clamped
to the minimum. Positional or named series/simple numeric percentages retain
the receiver-derived terminal series numeric kind; empty, all-`na`, upstream-
`na`, runtime typed-`na`, negative, and above-100 percentages return `na`.
`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)` interpolates between sorted
floor/ceiling members at `percentage / 100 * (count - 1)` and always returns
terminal `series float`, including for integer or single-element inputs.
Positional or named series/simple numeric percentages are accepted; empty,
all-`na`, upstream-`na`, runtime typed-`na`, out-of-range, and non-finite
results return `na`.
`.percentrank(index)` selects its target from the original zero-based array
index, filters `na` only from the comparison population, and returns
`count(value <= target) / non_na_count * 100` as terminal `series float`.
Duplicate values count independently. The positional or named index must be
simple int-compatible; empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, target-`na`, runtime
typed-`na`, negative, and out-of-range indexes return `na`.
`.covariance(id2, biased?)` requires a same-length runtime numeric second
array, pairs cells by original index, and filters pairs where either side is
`na`. It returns terminal `series float`, using the population denominator by
default and the sample denominator when the positional or named `biased` value
is `false` or `na`. Empty/all-`na`/upstream-`na` pairs, mismatched lengths,
sample populations below two pairs, and non-finite results return `na`.
`.standardize()` returns a fresh fixed `simple array<float>` from a concrete
numeric result and leaves the source unchanged. It computes the mean and
population standard deviation over non-`na` values, preserves `na` positions
when numeric values remain, and replaces every numeric position with `na` when
the standard deviation is zero or non-finite. Empty and all-`na` sources return
an empty array; an upstream-`na` source returns `na`. The result retains the
closed `.copy()`/`.abs()`/`.standardize()`/`.sort_indices()` continuation path.
`.variance(biased?)` returns fixed `series float` from a concrete numeric
result, filters `na` values, and leaves the source unchanged. Omitted or `true`
bias uses the population denominator, while positional or named `false` or
`na` bias uses the sample denominator. Population variance of one numeric
value is `0`; empty, all-`na`, upstream-`na`, insufficient-sample, and non-
finite results return `na`. The scalar result is terminal.
`.stdev(biased?)` shares `.variance()`'s concrete receiver, filtered-`na`,
population/sample bias, positional/named argument, empty/all-`na`/upstream-
`na`, sample-size, non-finite, source-independence, and terminal boundaries.
It returns fixed `series float` equal to the square root of the selected
variance, including population zero and unbiased `na` for one numeric value.
`.sort_indices(order?)` accepts concrete int, float, or string results and
returns an independent fixed `simple array<int>` of stable original indexes.
Default ascending and explicit descending order reuse the ordinary array
ordering rules, including float-`na`, string-empty, and equal-value stability.
Empty input returns an empty result, upstream `na` propagates, and the source
is unchanged. The int result preserves the closed array-result prefix for
nested sort/copy/read/search/transformation/statistic chains. Bool/color/
object/chart-point receivers, invalid order/arity, direct mutation, and UDT
call-result sorting without a prior identity-preserving binding remain
unsupported.
Generic UDT-array parameters are therefore iterable inside local UDFs and typed
local methods for the fixture-backed statement and final-expression forms,
including final results that return the UDT element itself or rebuild a
same-identity array from that element.
Supported operations are
`array.new_float`, `array.new_int`, `array.new_bool`, `array.new_string`,

`size/get/set/insert/push/pop/remove/shift/unshift/fill/first/last/copy/slice/concat/includes/indexof/lastindexof/reverse/join/clear`
may also be called with method syntax on a supported array receiver. Numeric
`binary_search/binary_search_leftmost/binary_search_rightmost/abs/min/max/sum/avg/range/median/mode/percentile_nearest_rank/percentile_linear_interpolation/percentrank/covariance/standardize/variance/stdev`
helpers may also be called with method syntax on float and int arrays.
`sort/sort_indices` may also be called with method syntax on float, int, and
string arrays.
`every/some` may also be called with method syntax on float, int, and bool
arrays.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT array `includes`, `indexof`, and `lastindexof`
compare UDT values structurally across every scalar field using the runtime
value equality relation. Different local UDT identities remain incompatible
even when their field shapes match.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT array `fill` replaces the whole array or a valid
half-open range with a same-local UDT value; values from different local UDT
identities remain rejected.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays and same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays
constructed through `array.from` support `join` stringification. Each element is
rendered as `TypeName(field0, field1, ...)`, using field declaration order and
the existing scalar `array.join` formatting for field values. This does not
enable `str.tostring(UDT)`.
Field mutation on a UDT value read from a same-local scalar-tree UDT array
mutates only that local value; it does not change the source array slot unless a
later same-UDT `array.set`/`set()` explicitly writes the value back.
Direct chained slot field mutation is supported for
`array.get(points, index).field := value` and `points.get(index).field := value`
when `points` is a same-local scalar-tree UDT array; it mutates a copy of the
selected slot and writes that updated UDT value back to the same array index,
including slice-window parent mirroring. The same operation remains rejected
inside UDFs under the function side-effect policy.
When a same-local scalar-tree UDT value is read from a UDT array, that value
may be passed to local pure UDFs that read scalar fields, passthrough the value,
or return a constructed same-local UDT. When bound to a local variable, that
local value may also be used as the receiver for local pure UDT methods. Local
and imported UDT constructor or method call-result receiver chains, such as
`Point.new(...).method(...)` or `lib.Point.new(...).method(...)`, are
fixture-backed for same-identity pure methods, including scalar and UDT
caller-side history reads. Broader non-constructor call-result receiver
expressions such as `array.get(...).method(...)` remain outside the parser
subset.
Local user-defined types are part of the executable Phase J subset only for
top-level scalar `int`/`float`/`bool`/`string`/`color` fields. `Type.new(...)`
constructs runtime values, field reads are typed from the local UDT
declaration, and ordinary variables, local for-expression and while-expression
constructor results, top-level/block-local/loop-local typed declarations
initialized from same-local-UDT ternary, switch, or `if` expressions,
top-level/block-local/loop-local typed declarations initialized or reassigned
from same-local-UDT `for` expressions, plus `var` declarations initialized from
`na`, same-UDT constructors, same-UDT ternary expressions, same-UDT switch
expressions, same-UDT `if` expressions, same-UDT `for` expressions, same-UDT
`for...in` expressions, or same-UDT `while` expressions may hold those values.
Different local UDT declarations remain distinct identities even when their
field shapes match. Mismatched assignment, typed initializer, nested UDT field
assignment, constructor argument, ternary branch, switch arm, and final-if branch
paths are rejected with fixture-backed user-facing diagnostics that name the
failed identity boundary.
Explicitly typed same-local scalar-tree UDT `varip` declarations initialized
from `na`, same-UDT constructors, same-identity aliases, or fixture-backed
same-UDT ternary/switch/if/for/for...in/while expressions, plus
direct-constructor-inferred or direct-alias-inferred same-local scalar-tree UDT
`varip` declarations, may also hold those values and persist them intrabar by
value.
Local scalar fields can be reassigned with `value.field := expr` in top-level,
branch, `for` loop, `while` loop, UDF-local variable bodies, and method-local
variable bodies; the assigned expression must be compatible with the declared
field type. UDF parameters may carry explicit same-local UDT types for the
same value-flow subset as inferred parameters. UDF parameter passthrough is
supported when the function returns the UDT
parameter itself, when a block-bodied function returns a local alias chain that
starts from that parameter through a block-local, ternary-expression, final-if, final-for,
final-for-in, final-while, or switch-expression alias, or when a nested passthrough UDF call
maps back to that parameter through those same alias forms. Pure UDFs may also construct and return a local UDT value,
directly, through nested pure constructor-helper UDF calls, or through
same-local-UDT ternary, switch, `if` expression, final if/else constructor
branches, final for bodies, final for-in bodies, or final while bodies, from
local UDT parameter scalar fields, scalar fields read through block-local UDT
aliases of those parameters, block-local scalar aliases of those fields,
parameters whose scalar types are explicitly declared or inferred at the
callsite, or block-local scalar aliases of those scalar parameters, using
positional or named constructor field arguments.
Positional and named UDF call arguments both preserve the parameter identity,
so returned UDT values can be assigned and field-read at the callsite.
Same-local scalar-tree UDT values read from UDT arrays may also be passed to
local pure UDFs, including passthrough and constructor-return UDFs.
Same-local or same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays may be declared as `varip`
when the declaration carries explicit UDT array identity, allowing realtime
handoff to retain the array id, backing contents, and UDT metadata between
forming updates.
UDF-local and method-local UDT variables may mutate scalar fields before
returning the updated value. Local scalar-tree UDT value history references,
including dynamic and `na` offsets plus local scalar-tree UDT field-produced history offsets and UDF- and method-returned passthrough and constructor-returned values, including nested scalar-tree UDT returns, plus same-UDT `if`, `switch`, `for`,
`for...in`, and `while` expression results, global or
parameter field mutation inside UDFs, receiver/parameter/global field mutation
inside methods, non-constructor-inferred UDT `varip`, nested-field UDT `varip`,
and non-scalar UDT arrays remain outside the claim.
Imported UDT identity is supported for scalar-tree constructors, direct and nested field-read,
ordinary same-imported-UDT reassignment, explicit scalar-tree imported typed
declarations, and same-imported scalar-field typed array declarations, plus
direct UDF parameter passthrough, imported UDF block-local,
ternary-expression, final-if, final-for, final-for-in, final-while, or
switch-expression alias passthrough,
nested UDF parameter passthrough over those forms, exported-function same-imported UDT
typed parameters, same-imported scalar-tree UDT array typed UDF parameters
including named arguments and caller-side history reads from returned array elements,
same-imported scalar-tree UDT array typed method parameters
including named arguments and caller-side history reads from returned array elements,
and direct, nested, ternary, if, for, for-in, while, or switch constructor-return results, and
same-imported-identity ternary,
`if`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, or `for...in` expression results with
caller-side history reads, ordinary
imported UDT `var` declarations, scalar-tree imported UDT `varip` declarations,
same-imported scalar-tree UDT array `varip` declarations, and scalar-tree
root-field replacement in top-level, branch, `for`-loop, `while`-loop, and UDF-local
  statement contexts, plus method-local scalar-tree root-field replacement and scalar-tree
  value history, including dynamic and `na` offsets, imported scalar-tree UDT
  field-produced history offsets from direct/nested imported fields and fields on
  imported UDF- and method-returned values, and UDF- and method-returned
passthrough and constructor-returned
values, plus `array.from` size/get/first/last plus set replacement field
reads, push append field reads, unshift prepend field reads, insert insertion
field reads, fill replacement field reads, join positional stringification,
includes/indexof/lastindexof structural equality search, sort/sort_indices by
int/float/string sort_field, pop/remove/shift return field reads, clear-size
reset, copy independent field reads, reverse reordered field reads, slice
window field reads, concat appended field reads, and
statement/expression/index-value for-in value-copy field reads;
local/imported structural lookalikes remain distinct assignment identities.
Exported imported UDTs whose scalar-tree metadata depends on private library
UDTs can be carried as typed `na` values and read through value history without
exposing the private dependency. Local and imported non-scalar UDT identities can
also be carried as direct, `var`, or explicit typed-na `varip` values, flow through ternary,
`if`, `switch`, `for`, `for...in`, and `while` identity results, pass through
local UDFs, imported exported UDFs, local methods, and imported receiver-style
or alias-qualified methods including same-imported non-receiver method
parameters, read through history, expose direct fields from typed `na` values
through field reads/history, and be tested with `na()`, while their constructors
remain outside the supported non-scalar subset.
The imported collection claim also includes same-imported scalar-tree UDT array
returns from imported UDFs and user methods within the direct/alias,
copy/new/from, private-nested, typed-method, final-control-flow, and dual-alias
isolation subset above. Imported UDT collections beyond those returns and the
scalar-tree `array.from` size/get/first/last, set-replacement, push-append,
unshift-prepend, insert-insertion, fill-replacement, join-stringification,
search-structural-equality, sort-by-field, pop/remove/shift return, clear-size,
copy-read, reverse-read, slice-window, concat-append, and for-in-value-copy
subset remain outside the claim. The same applies to direct private imported UDT
access, mixed or non-scalar imported array-return identities, conflicting
identities within one tuple UDT-array slot, direct call-result array methods
outside the read-only `size`/`get`/`first`/`last`/`copy` set,
bound matrix-result call-result receivers other than exact matrix-receiver
`values.copy()`/`values.transpose()`/`values.submatrix(...)`/
`values.kron(other)`/`values.diff(other)`/`values.pow(power)`/
`values.inv()`/`values.pinv()`/`values.eigenvectors()`/matrix-valued
`values.mult(other)`, unqualified local-UDF matrix-result receivers without a
concrete supported matrix kind, local/imported user-method matrix-result
receivers without a concrete supported matrix kind, unregistered or unresolved
user-function matrix-result receivers,
built-in-qualified/template
call-result receivers outside the exact static `array.*` allowlist and
cross-namespace dynamic paths, nested field mutation, UDF
parameter/global field side effects, and method receiver/parameter/global field
side effects.
Registered imported pure-function results with one concrete supported matrix
kind carry only call-specific matrix-kind metadata and expose the same closed
rows/columns/elements_count/get/copy/submatrix/transpose set with
numeric `.diff(other)`, `.eigenvectors()`, `.inv()`, `.kron(other)`, `.mult(other)`, `.pinv()`, and `.pow(power)` added after the receiver-kind check and
copy/diff/eigenvectors/inv/kron/mult/pinv/pow/submatrix/transpose continuation; they do not widen imported UDT
identity.
Qualified user-defined and unqualified plain local UDF results plus the
exact static `array.*` allowlist and cross-namespace array-capable path support
those eight array helpers for
currently supported array kinds; UDT arrays retain the concrete
same-local/same-imported scalar-tree identity gate, and scalar UDT results from
unqualified local UDFs may invoke existing pure methods. Built-in producer
`get`/`first`/`last` element results and
`includes`/`indexof`/`lastindexof` search results
remain terminal and do not open that scalar UDT method composition path. The seven
fixed cross-namespace producers and
array-returning `matrix.mult` overloads return only scalar arrays and add no
UDT/import identity flow. Namespace matrix-returning `matrix.mult` overloads,
exact namespace `matrix.copy`/`matrix.transpose`/`matrix.submatrix`, and
fixed-float namespace `matrix.kron`/`matrix.diff`/`matrix.pow`/`matrix.inv`/
`matrix.pinv`/`matrix.eigenvectors` add
only the exact matrix read/copy set above. Copy/transpose/submatrix preserve the
scalar matrix element kind; transpose swaps shape, submatrix selects a range,
kron expands both dimensions, diff preserves its selected matrix operand's
shape and left-to-right subtraction order, pow preserves square shape across
identity/copy/positive powers, inv preserves square shape or yields `na` for
singular/invalid-cell inputs, and pinv swaps rectangular shape while preserving
singular matrix results, and eigenvectors preserves square shape or yields
`na` for invalid-cell/non-real/incomplete results. All fixed producers return
float matrices, while the five exact `matrix.new<T>` templates retain their
float/int/bool/string/color matrix kind, rectangular shape,
initial/default-`na` cells, and fresh allocation. None of these paths carries
UDT/import identity.
Tuple-contained
same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays are supported when destructured, with
identity tracked independently per slot. Non-scalar UDT value history outside the local/imported
label/line/box/chart.point-field fixture with direct `chart.point` field chains,
and imported UDT value history outside the scalar-tree metadata and typed-`na`
non-scalar identity subsets, also remain outside the claim.

Pure user-defined methods are supported for local UDT receivers with scalar,
`chart.point`, scalar array, object-id array, chart.point array, local UDT,
same-local scalar-tree UDT array, or same-imported scalar-tree UDT array typed
parameters, including direct `chart.point` constructor/passthrough returns with
caller-side history reads, direct UDT passthrough returns with caller-side history reads, nested scalar-tree UDT method returns with caller-side history reads, block-local
or ternary-expression receiver or local UDT parameter alias passthrough
returns, final if/else, final for, final for-in, final while, or
switch-expression local UDT alias passthrough returns, nested method UDT
parameter passthrough returns, and local and nested scalar-tree UDT
constructor returns with caller-side history reads, directly,
through nested pure constructor-helper UDF calls, or through same-local-UDT
ternary, switch, `if` expression, final if/else constructor branches, final for
bodies, final for-in bodies, or final while bodies, from receiver or local UDT
parameter scalar fields, scalar fields read through block-local receiver or
local UDT parameter aliases, block-local scalar aliases of those fields,
inferred scalar parameters, or block-local scalar aliases of those parameters
using positional or named constructor field arguments. The
receiver is analyzed as the first internal argument and the method body lowers
through the existing inlined UDF path, so callsite state and side-effect checks
follow the local function rules. Scalar method returns may be used as dynamic
history offsets, including returned `na` offsets, and method-returned scalar
series values may be read through constant, dynamic, or `na` history offsets at
the caller. Method returns preserve fixture-backed `input` and `simple`
qualifiers from scalar and simple-string parameters through expression,
block-local, final-if, final-loop, and switch block return shapes when the
receiver is not used in the returned value. Method final-if branch and switch
block loops plus final `for`, `for...in`, and `while` loop returns include the
loop header, iterable, or condition qualifier, so series-controlled method loop
results remain rejected by simple-only arguments. When a
pure method returns the receiver itself, a block-local alias chain that starts
from the receiver or another local UDT parameter, a ternary-expression alias of
one of those values, another local UDT parameter, a nested method passthrough
call that maps back to one of those parameters, or a local UDT constructed
directly, through a nested pure constructor-helper UDF call, or through
same-local-UDT ternary, switch, final if/else constructor
branches, same-local-UDT `if` expressions, final for bodies, final for-in
bodies, or final while bodies, from receiver or local UDT parameter scalar
fields, scalar fields read through block-local receiver or local UDT parameter
aliases, block-local scalar aliases of those fields, inferred scalar
parameters, or block-local scalar aliases of those parameters,
the callsite keeps that UDT identity so the returned value can be assigned and
field-read. Same-local scalar-tree UDT values read from UDT arrays can also be
bound to locals and used as local pure method receivers. Receiver-style and
alias-qualified scalar-tree imported UDT method calls, including the same method
name on different scalar-tree receiver types, are supported when the imported
method stays inside the scalar/imported-UDT parameter subset and the
alias-qualified form receives a same-identity imported UDT as its first
argument; non-receiver method parameters may use named or reordered arguments,
including direct receiver passthrough or same-identity parameter
passthrough returns, block-local, ternary-expression, final-if, final-for,
final-for-in, final-while, or switch-expression receiver or parameter alias passthrough
returns, nested imported method passthrough returns,
direct, nested scalar-tree, ternary, if, for, for-in, while, or switch
same-imported-identity constructor returns, and method-local scalar field
mutation before returning a local UDT value. Returned imported UDT values in
that subset support caller-side history reads followed by scalar-tree field reads.
Local methods may return same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays from typed array
parameters or fresh local array construction. Direct and block-alias returns
retain the argument identity, while copy/new/from and nested/final-control-flow
returns preserve the identity selected for the current call. Qualified
user-defined results returning any currently supported array kind, unqualified
plain local UDF array results, the exact built-in `array.*` producer allowlist,
and the cross-namespace array-capable path support direct
`.size()`/`.get(index)`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.copy()`/`.slice(index_from, index_to)`/`.concat(id2)`/`.includes(value)`/
`.indexof(value)`/`.lastindexof(value)`, plus bool/int/float-only `.every()`/`.some()` and numeric-only
`.binary_search(value)`/`.binary_search_leftmost(value)`/
`.binary_search_rightmost(value)`/`.abs()`/`.min(nth?)`/`.max(nth?)`/`.sum()`/
`.avg()`/`.range()`/`.median()`/`.mode()`/`.percentile_nearest_rank(percentage)`/`.percentile_linear_interpolation(percentage)`/`.percentrank(index)`/`.covariance(id2, biased?)`/`.standardize()`/`.variance(biased?)`/`.stdev(biased?)`, plus int/float/string `.sort_indices(order?)` or, on identity-preserving UDT paths, exact-identity scalar-tree UDT `.sort_indices(order?, sort_field?)`, and scalar/same-identity scalar-tree UDT `.join(separator?)`, without widening arbitrary call-
result receivers. UDT arrays retain the concrete
same-local/same-imported scalar-tree identity gate; scalar UDT results from an
unqualified local UDF may invoke the existing pure method subset. That scalar
method exception does not apply to a built-in producer's terminal
`.get()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.includes()`/`.indexof()`/`.lastindexof()`/
`.binary_search()`/`.binary_search_leftmost()`/`.binary_search_rightmost()` or
`.join()` result. Numeric `.abs()` returns a fresh same-kind array,
`.slice(...)` returns a same-kind live window, and `.concat(id2)` mutates and
returns the receiver id; all three may continue through the admitted array
chain. The seven fixed cross-namespace
producers and the array-returning
`matrix.mult` overloads are scalar-array-only and do
not widen UDT identity. Namespace matrix-returning `matrix.mult` overloads and
exact namespace `matrix.copy`/`matrix.transpose`/`matrix.submatrix` plus
fixed-float namespace `matrix.kron`/`matrix.diff`/`matrix.pow`/`matrix.inv`/
`matrix.pinv`/`matrix.eigenvectors` add only the exact matrix read/copy set
above. The five exact `matrix.new<T>` templates add the same read/copy set while
retaining their scalar matrix element kind. None widens UDT identity. Bound
matrix-result receivers other than exact `values.copy()`/`values.transpose()`/
`values.submatrix(...)`/`values.kron(other)`/`values.diff(other)`/
`values.pow(power)`/`values.inv()`/`values.pinv()`/`values.eigenvectors()`/
matrix-valued `values.mult(other)`, local/imported user-method matrix-result
receivers without a concrete supported matrix kind, unregistered or unresolved
user-function matrix-result receivers, unqualified local-UDF results without a concrete
supported matrix kind,
built-in-qualified/template
call results outside the exact static and dynamic paths, and other array or
matrix helpers remain gated. The scalar `map.new<K,V>` and namespace
`map.copy(existing)` result paths carry only map template metadata and likewise
do not widen UDT identity.
Registered imported pure-function matrix-result dispatch likewise carries only
the concrete matrix kind and registered function provenance, with no imported
UDT identity.
Methods with receiver/parameter/global field side effects, recursion,
unsupported parameter families, mismatched UDT parameter identity, unknown
receivers, and alias-qualified imported method receiver type mismatches remain
rejected. Non-array method calls outside the local/imported UDT method subset
and the exact namespace matrix-result path continue to fail with receiver/type
diagnostics.
Float arrays accept int or float values and store them as floats. Int arrays
accept int values. Bool arrays accept bool values. String
arrays accept string values. Color arrays accept color values. Label and line
arrays accept matching drawing ids or `na`; `array.copy` is shallow for those references.
Other array
constructors and unsupported `array.*` functions are rejected. Array assignment
and UDF argument binding pass the runtime array id by reference. `array.copy`
allocates a new array id with the same current element values, so later
mutations do not affect the source. `array.slice` returns a same-kind shallow
window over the parent array's half-open `[index_from, index_to)` range; slice
mutations mirror the parent window, slice insertions widen the window, invalid
creation bounds return `na`, and later parent mutations that move the window
out of bounds are runtime errors. An immediate allowed postfix read observes
that live window, whereas `array.slice(...).copy()` captures the window's
current values in an independent array. `array.concat` requires two arrays of
the same kind, appends the second array's current values to the first array in
place, and returns the first array id. Its immediate postfix reader is
non-mutating, but the concat producer remains a mutation and is rejected inside
UDFs. `array.get`, `array.set`, `array.insert`,
and `array.remove`
support negative indexes from the array end. `array.get`, `array.set`, and
`array.insert` accept integer-compatible indexes, including `series int`, in
namespace and method forms. `array.insert` inserts before a
valid index, appends when the positive index equals the current size, and
raises a runtime error for out-of-bounds indexes. `array.remove` removes and
returns a valid indexed element, or raises a runtime error when the index is
out of bounds. `array.fill`
replaces all elements by default or a half-open `[index_from, index_to)` window
when bounds are supplied; invalid ranges are no-ops.
`array.includes`, `array.indexof`, and `array.lastindexof` use structural
equality for same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays and same-imported scalar-tree
UDT arrays constructed through `array.from`; `array.indexof` and
`array.lastindexof` return `-1` when the value is not present. Numeric binary
search helpers are limited to float and int arrays and
expect the current array contents to be sorted ascending. `array.binary_search`
returns `-1` when the value is not found; leftmost/rightmost return the nearest
existing insertion-side index and return `-1` for empty arrays.
`array.every` and `array.some` are limited to float, int, and bool arrays;
false, zero, and `na` values are falsey, other numeric values are truthy, and
empty arrays return `true` for `every` and `false` for `some`. Numeric helpers
`array.abs`, `array.min`, `array.max`, `array.sum`, `array.avg`, `array.range`,
`array.median`, `array.mode`, `array.covariance`, `array.standardize`,
`array.variance`, and `array.stdev` are limited to float and int arrays.
`array.abs` allocates a new same-kind array, preserves `na`, and leaves the
source array unchanged. `array.covariance` requires two same-size numeric
arrays, skips pairs where either side is `na`, defaults to a biased population
estimate, and returns `na` when no numeric pair remains or an unbiased sample
has fewer than two numeric pairs.
`array.standardize` allocates a new float array, uses non-`na` values to
calculate mean and population standard deviation, preserves `na` element
positions when at least one numeric value exists, and returns an empty array
for empty/all-`na` arrays. The remaining helpers ignore `na` elements and
return `na` when no numeric element is present. `array.range` returns max minus
min. `array.mode`
returns the smallest value among tied most-frequent values and returns `na`
when all remaining values occur only once. Percentile helpers operate on
non-`na` values sorted ascending. Percentages outside `0..=100`,
empty/all-`na` arrays, and invalid `array.percentrank` indexes return `na`.
`array.variance` and `array.stdev`
accept an optional `biased` bool argument that defaults to `true`; passing
`false` uses the sample denominator and returns `na` when fewer than two
numeric values remain.
`array.sort` and `array.sort_indices` support float, int, and string arrays,
plus same-local scalar-tree UDT arrays and same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays
constructed through `array.from` when a compile-time `sort_field` names an int,
float, or string field. They sort ascending by default and accept
`order.ascending` or `order.descending`.
`na` values and empty strings sort last in ascending order and first in
descending order. `array.sort` mutates the source array; `array.sort_indices`
returns a new int array of original indexes in sorted order and leaves the
source array unchanged.
`array.reverse` reverses any supported typed array in place. `array.join`
converts supported array elements to string with the default numeric format,
uses `,` as the default separator, and returns an empty string for empty arrays.
Color elements render as normalized integer color values. Same-local
scalar-tree UDT arrays and same-imported scalar-tree UDT arrays constructed
through `array.from` use `TypeName(field0, field1, ...)` element rendering.
Out-of-range
`array.get`, `array.set`, `array.insert`, and `array.remove` on an existing
array raise runtime errors; empty `array.pop`, empty `array.shift`, and
`array.first`/`array.last` on empty arrays return `na`. Out-of-range
`array.fill` ranges are no-ops. Negative array sizes fail at runtime. Each
array can contain at most 100,000 elements; creation, push, unshift, insert, or
concat operations beyond that limit fail at runtime.

User-defined functions may receive supported arrays and use read-only
operations such as `array.size` and `array.get`. Pine v4 UDF bodies also admit
the exact namespace-call subset `array.set`, `array.pop`, `array.unshift`, and
`array.clear`; every other collection mutation inside a UDF remains rejected.

The current map subset supports runtime-owned empty map ids through
`map.new<K, V>()` where both template types are one of `int`, `float`, `bool`,
`string`, or `color`. `map.size(id)` accepts map ids and returns the current
entry count. `map.put`, `map.get`, and `map.contains` are supported for those
scalar key/value templates: put inserts or replaces the entry for an equal key,
get returns the current value or `na` for a missing key, and contains returns a
series bool. `map.clear` removes all entries from the map id and the same id can
be reused by later `map.put` calls. `map.remove` deletes a present key and is a
no-op for missing keys. Assignment passes the runtime map id by reference, and
`map.copy` returns an independent cloned backing store carrying the same scalar
key/value template. `map.keys` and `map.values` return independent array
snapshots in insertion order using the map's scalar key or value kind. For the
five-scalar-template subset on each side, those namespace-call results may use
the closed array-result helper set described above. The key/value return kind
follows the corresponding template side; `.copy()` and `.slice(index_from, index_to)`, plus numeric `.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string `.sort_indices(order?)` may continue another allowed array chain and remain
independent of both the map and the first snapshot. Empty and typed-`na` maps
retain ordinary upstream behavior, while every scalar key/value snapshot also
admits terminal `.join(separator?)`.
Negative and out-of-bounds indexes keep ordinary array-result semantics.
`map.put_all` requires source and target maps to have the same scalar key/value
template and mutates the target by replacing existing values without moving
their keys and appending new keys in source insertion order. Ordinary realtime
rollback clones the confirmed runtime map store for each forming update, so
unconfirmed map mutations do not leak across forming executions. Equivalent
method aliases lower to the same namespace calls for the supported subset.
Direct `for key in id` and `for [key, value] in id` map iteration snapshots the
current insertion order of scalar key/value pairs for statement and expression
loops. A single loop local receives the key using the map key template kind. In
key/value form, the first loop local receives the key and the second receives the
value using the map value template kind. If the loop body changes the map size,
runtime execution reports an error.
Scalar `map<K,V>` typed declarations preserve map template metadata for `na`
initialization and same-template assignment. Scalar bare `map` declarations
initialized from a known scalar map expression preserve the inferred template
metadata. Scalar map history references preserve that template metadata for
historical map receivers. Non-scalar templates, non-map map receivers, and bare
map declarations without a known scalar map initializer remain unsupported with
targeted diagnostics. Scalar map `varip` declarations are supported for the same
scalar key/value template subset. User-defined function parameters receive
the caller's scalar map template metadata, enabling read-only map helpers inside
pure UDF bodies while mutating map helpers remain side-effect rejected.

User-defined function parameters may also use typed array templates in canonical
`array<T>` form or `T[]` aliases for supported scalar, object-id, `chart.point`,
same-local scalar-tree UDT, and same-imported scalar-tree UDT array element
kinds. The parameter receives the caller's array id plus element-kind or UDT
identity metadata, so read-only array calls type-check through the typed
parameter and mismatched array element kinds or UDT array identities are
rejected at analysis time.

The current matrix subset supports runtime-owned float matrix ids through
`matrix.new<float>(rows, columns, initial_value?)`, `matrix.get`,
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`,
`matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.kron`, `matrix.mult`,
`matrix.diff`, `matrix.pow`,
`matrix.add_row`,
`matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`,
`matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.sort`,
`matrix.submatrix`,
`matrix.rows`, `matrix.columns`, `matrix.elements_count`, `matrix.is_square`,
`matrix.is_binary`, `matrix.is_diagonal`, `matrix.is_identity`,
`matrix.is_symmetric`, `matrix.is_antisymmetric`, `matrix.is_stochastic`,
`matrix.is_zero`, `matrix.sum`, `matrix.avg`, `matrix.min`, `matrix.max`,
`matrix.mode`, `matrix.trace`, `matrix.det`, `matrix.eigenvalues`,
`matrix.eigenvectors`, `matrix.inv`, `matrix.pinv`, `matrix.rank`,
`matrix.row`, and `matrix.col`.
Matrix cells
hold float or `na` values; int cell inputs are coerced to float. Matrix
assignment and UDF
argument binding pass the runtime matrix id by reference, while `matrix.copy`
allocates an independent matrix store snapshot of the current cells.
The subset also supports runtime-owned int matrix ids through
`matrix.new<int>(rows, columns, initial_value?)` plus `matrix.get`,
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`,
`matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.submatrix`, `matrix.row`,
`matrix.col`, `matrix.kron`, `matrix.mult`, `matrix.diff`, `matrix.pow`,
`matrix.add_row`, `matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`, `matrix.remove_col`,
`matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.sort`, `matrix.rows`,
`matrix.columns`, `matrix.elements_count`, and `matrix.is_square`,
`matrix.is_binary`, `matrix.is_diagonal`,
`matrix.is_identity`, `matrix.is_symmetric`, `matrix.is_antisymmetric`,
`matrix.is_stochastic`, `matrix.is_zero`, `matrix.sum`, `matrix.avg`,
`matrix.min`, `matrix.max`, `matrix.mode`, `matrix.trace`, `matrix.det`,
`matrix.eigenvalues`, `matrix.eigenvectors`, `matrix.inv`, `matrix.pinv`, and
`matrix.rank`, including the corresponding supported method aliases. Int matrix
cells hold int or `na` values, and the
int initial value plus `matrix.set`/`matrix.fill` write values must be
int-compatible.
The subset also supports runtime-owned bool matrix ids through
`matrix.new<bool>(rows, columns, initial_value?)` plus `matrix.get`,
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.copy`, `matrix.transpose`,
`matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`, `matrix.submatrix`, `matrix.row`,
`matrix.col`, `matrix.add_row`, `matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`,
`matrix.remove_col`, `matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, `matrix.rows`,
`matrix.columns`, `matrix.elements_count`, and `matrix.is_square`, including
the corresponding supported method aliases. Bool matrix cells hold bool or
`na` values, and the bool initial value plus `matrix.set`/`matrix.fill` write
values must be bool-compatible.
`matrix.transpose` allocates an independent matrix store with swapped row and
column counts.
`matrix.reverse` mutates the existing matrix in place, preserving shape while
moving `(row, column)` to `(rows - 1 - row, columns - 1 - column)`.
`matrix.swap_rows` mutates the existing matrix in place by exchanging two
validated row ranges, preserving shape and treating same-row or zero-column
swaps as no-ops after row validation.
`matrix.swap_columns` mutates the existing matrix in place by exchanging two
validated column positions across all rows, preserving shape and treating
same-column or zero-row swaps as no-ops after column validation.
`matrix.sort` mutates the existing matrix in place by reordering complete row
ranges according to a selected column, defaults to column `0`, accepts
`order.ascending` and `order.descending`, preserves original row order for
equal keys, and places `na` keys last ascending and first descending.
`matrix.submatrix` returns an independent matrix copy of a selected half-open
row/column range, defaulting omitted bounds to the source matrix's full row or
column extent and allowing empty row or column slices.
`matrix.row` and `matrix.col` return independent row/column snapshots:
`array<float>` for float matrices, `array<int>` for int matrices, and
`array<bool>` for bool matrices, `array<string>` for string matrices, and
`array<color>` for color matrices. Namespace-call results may immediately use
the closed array-result helper set described above; `.copy()` plus numeric
`.abs()` and `.standardize()`, and numeric-or-string `.sort_indices(order?)`,
may continue another allowed array chain, and
each transformed array remains independent of the source matrix and the first
row/column snapshot. Ordinary
`var` matrix ids persist across bars, and
realtime forming-bar rollback restores the confirmed matrix store for
non-`varip` updates. Matrix construction rejects negative row or column counts
and is bounded by a 100,000-cell runtime budget before allocation.
`matrix.set`, `matrix.fill`, `matrix.reverse`, `matrix.reshape`,
`matrix.add_row`, `matrix.add_col`, `matrix.remove_row`,
`matrix.remove_col`, `matrix.swap_rows`, `matrix.swap_columns`, and
`matrix.sort` inside
user-defined functions remain rejected by the collection side-effect boundary.

supported as method-call aliases for the matching
namespace calls.
`values.set(row, column, value)` is
also supported as a
method-call alias for `matrix.set(values, row, column, value)` outside
user-defined functions, `values.copy()` is supported as a method-call alias for
`matrix.copy(values)`, `values.transpose()` lowers to

`matrix.submatrix(values, ...)`, and `values.kron(other)` lowers to
`matrix.kron(values, other)`, and `values.mult(other)` lowers to
`matrix.mult(values, other)` for matrix or scalar-right operands, and
`values.diff(other)` lowers to `matrix.diff(values, other)` for matrix or
scalar-right operands, and `values.pow(power)`
lowers to `matrix.pow(values, power)`. Reshape preserves element order and
element count. `matrix.kron` accepts runtime-owned float or int matrix operands
and returns an independent Kronecker-product `matrix<float>` with expanded
shape, propagates `na` or non-finite source cells to `na` result cells,
preserves zero-dimension results, and is bounded by the 100,000-cell matrix
budget. Matrix-by-matrix `matrix.mult` accepts runtime-owned float or int
matrix operands and returns an independent `matrix<float>` product with shape
`left.rows()` by `right.columns()`, requires
`left.columns() == right.rows()`, propagates `na` or non-finite contributing
cells to `na` result cells, preserves zero-dimension results, and is bounded by
the 100,000-cell matrix budget. Scalar namespace `matrix.mult` accepts a
numeric or `na` scalar on either side of a matrix operand and returns an
independent same-shape `matrix<float>`. The `values.mult(scalar)` method alias
supports the scalar-right form. `matrix.mult(values, vector)` and
`values.mult(vector)` accept a right-hand `array<float>` or `array<int>` as a
column vector, require `vector.size() == values.columns()`, and return an
independent `array<float>` whose length is `values.rows()`. Namespace
`matrix.mult(vector, values)` accepts a left-hand numeric array as a row vector,
requires `vector.size() == values.rows()`, and returns an independent
`array<float>` whose length is `values.columns()`. Namespace
`matrix.mult(left_vector, right_vector)` accepts numeric array pairs with equal
length, treats them as a row vector and column vector, and returns an
independent single-element `array<float>` dot-product result. Non-numeric-array
`matrix.mult` overloads remain unsupported.
Matrix-by-matrix `matrix.diff` accepts runtime-owned float or int matrix
operands and returns an independent `matrix<float>` element-wise difference
with matching operand shape, requires identical row and column counts,
propagates `na` or non-finite source cells to `na` result cells, and preserves
zero-dimension results. Scalar namespace `matrix.diff` accepts a numeric or
`na` scalar on either side of a matrix operand and returns an independent
same-shape `matrix<float>`. The `values.diff(scalar)` method alias supports
the scalar-right form.
`matrix.pow` accepts runtime-owned square float or int matrices and returns
independent `matrix<float>` powers, with
power `0` producing an identity matrix, power `1` producing an independent
copy, larger powers using matrix multiplication `na` propagation, empty
`0 x 0` inputs returning empty `0 x 0` results, and runtime errors for
non-square matrices or negative powers.
`matrix.elements_count` returns the current row-count by
column-count element count, including zero for zero-dimension matrices.
`matrix.is_square` returns whether row and column counts are equal.
`matrix.is_zero` returns true when every stored numeric cell is zero, false for
any non-zero or `na` cell, and true for zero-element matrices.
`matrix.is_binary` returns true when every stored numeric cell is exactly zero
or one, false for any other numeric value or `na` cell, and true for
zero-element matrices.
`matrix.is_diagonal` returns true when every cell outside the main diagonal is
zero, false for any non-zero or `na` off-diagonal cell, allows any
main-diagonal value, does not require a square shape, and returns true for
zero-element matrices.
`matrix.is_identity` returns true only for square matrices whose main diagonal
cells are exactly one and whose off-diagonal cells are exactly zero, false for
any `na` cell, false for non-square matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0`
matrices.
`matrix.is_symmetric` returns true only for square matrices whose stored
numeric cells match their transposed counterparts, false for any `na` cell,
false for non-square matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0` matrices.
`matrix.is_antisymmetric` returns true only for square matrices whose main
diagonal cells are exactly zero and whose off-diagonal cells are the negatives
of their transposed counterparts, false for any `na` cell, false for non-square
matrices, and true for empty `0 x 0` matrices.
`matrix.is_stochastic` returns true when every cell is a finite non-negative
number and either every row sums exactly to one or every column sums exactly to
one, returns false for any `na` or negative cell, and returns false for
zero-element matrices.
`matrix.sum` returns the sum of numeric cells in row-major order,
ignoring `na` cells and returning `na` when no numeric cells exist;
`matrix.avg` returns the average over the same non-`na` numeric cell set.
`matrix.min` and `matrix.max` scan the same non-`na` numeric cell set.
`matrix.mode` returns the smallest most-frequent non-`na` numeric cell when a
value repeats and otherwise returns `na`.
`matrix.trace` sums non-`na` numeric cells on the main diagonal over
`min(rows, columns)` positions and returns `na` when the diagonal has no
numeric cells.
`matrix.det` computes the determinant of square runtime-owned float or int
matrices, returns `1.0` for empty `0 x 0` matrices, returns `na` for any `na`
or non-finite cell, and raises a runtime error for non-square matrices.
`matrix.eigenvalues` returns an independent `array<float>` of real eigenvalues
for square runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns an empty array for
empty `0 x 0` matrices, returns `na` for any `na` or non-finite cell and for
non-real eigenvalue results, and raises a runtime error for non-square
matrices. Its namespace-call result may immediately use the closed numeric
array-result helper set, with `.copy()`, `.abs()`, `.standardize()`, and
`.sort_indices()` nestable and with existing empty/`na`, index, and bounds
semantics retained.
`matrix.eigenvectors` returns an independent `matrix<float>` whose columns are
real eigenvectors for square runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns an
independent empty `0 x 0` matrix for empty `0 x 0` input, returns `na` for any
`na` or non-finite cell and for non-real or incomplete eigenvector results, and
raises a runtime error for non-square matrices.
`matrix.inv` computes an independent inverse matrix for non-singular square
runtime-owned float or int matrices, returns an independent empty `0 x 0`
matrix for empty `0 x 0` input, returns `na` for any `na` or non-finite cell
and for singular matrices, and raises a runtime error for non-square matrices.
`matrix.pinv` computes an independent Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix with
row/column counts swapped from the source, returns an independent zero-cell
matrix for zero-row or zero-column input, returns `na` for any `na` or
non-finite cell, and supports singular and rectangular matrices.
`matrix.rank` computes the rank of rectangular runtime-owned float or int
matrices, returns `0` for zero-element matrices, and returns `na` for any `na`
or non-finite cell.
`values.sum()`, `values.avg()`, `values.min()`, `values.max()`,
`values.mode()`, `values.trace()`, `values.det()`, `values.eigenvalues()`,
`values.inv()`, `values.pinv()`, and `values.rank()` lower to the matching read-only
namespace helpers.
`matrix.add_row` copies an element-kind-matched row array into the matrix,
requires the row length to match the current column count, and inserts at an
index in `0..=rows` while preserving row order around the insertion. Float
matrices require `array<float>` row data, int matrices require `array<int>`
row data, and bool matrices require `array<bool>` row data. `matrix.add_col` copies an element-kind-matched column array into the
matrix, requires the column length to match the current row count, and inserts
at an index in `0..=columns` while preserving column order around the
insertion. Float matrices require `array<float>` column data, int matrices
require `array<int>` column data, and bool matrices require `array<bool>`
column data.
`matrix.remove_row` deletes an existing row using the same row-index bounds as
row reads. `matrix.remove_col` deletes an existing column using the same
column-index bounds as column reads. Matrix templates beyond `float`, `int`,
`bool`, `string`, and `color`, other method syntax, and bare matrix or matrix
templates beyond float/int/bool/string/color typed declarations remain outside
the current subset. `matrix<float>`, `matrix<int>`, `matrix<bool>`,
`matrix<string>`, and `matrix<color>` typed declarations accept compatible
matrix values or `na`; statement-form matrix `for...in` binds each loop value to
an independent row snapshot array and the optional index to the zero-based row
number. Matrix history is supported for committed matrix snapshots that return
fresh copies. Single `chart.point` value history returns retained previous point
values from direct constructors, UDF returns, user-defined method returns, or
`if`/`switch`/`for`/`for...in`/`while` expression results, supports dynamic
`na` offsets, and is independent from later mutation of the current point
value. Explicit `chart.point` typed
declarations accept compatible point values, `na`, and compatible control-flow
expression results.
Single `chart.point` value `varip` declarations persist
point values intrabar by value, including field-mutation writeback. UDF
parameters may declare scalar or `chart.point` types; typed `chart.point`
parameters preserve constructor-return and read-only passthrough value flow,
including caller-side field reads and history reads. Matrix
`varip` declarations are supported for the same runtime owned matrix element
kinds, with realtime backing-store handoff across forming updates.

## `na`

`na` behavior must be implemented deliberately. It must not be represented as
Rust `None` in the evaluator because `na` participates in Pine expressions.

Initial rules:

- Arithmetic with `na` returns `na`.
- Historical references outside available history return `na`.
- `na(x)` returns `true` when `x` is `na`, otherwise `false`.
- `nz(x)` returns `x` when `x` is not `na`; otherwise it returns the default
  replacement for the overload or the explicit replacement argument.
- `nz(x, replacement)` returns `replacement` when `x` is `na`.
- A condition that evaluates to `na` should follow the selected Pine version's
  documented behavior. Phase 1 should target one version policy and test it
  explicitly.

The analyzer should track Pine version because boolean `na` behavior differs
across versions. If a version-specific behavior is not implemented, it must be
reported as unsupported instead of approximated silently.

## Declarations

Normal declarations are evaluated whenever their containing scope executes:

```pine
x = close + open
```

The declaration creates or updates the current bar value for that symbol. If the
symbol is series-qualified, the current value is committed after bar execution.

Normal and tuple block-local declarations inside `if` blocks are executable and
scoped to their branch. The analyzer records resolved symbol bindings before
lowering so locals do not leak into outer scopes. Tuple declarations in local
scopes always create local symbols, even when an outer scope already contains the
same names.

`for i = start to end` is executable for integer ranges with an optional
explicit `by step`. The loop counter is a block-local integer symbol scoped to
the loop body. Range and step expressions must be int-typed, and literal zero
steps are rejected; series-qualified bounds are evaluated for the current bar
when the loop statement executes.
`break` and `continue` are valid only inside a loop and target the nearest
enclosing loop.
Loop expressions are supported for scalar and tuple declaration values when the
body ends with an expression. The expression determines the loop result type;
bodies that do not end with an expression are rejected with `E_LOOP_RETURN`.
When a loop is itself the final statement of a user-defined function, a
side-effect-only final body expression is also a valid `void` result. This
function-return exception does not make ordinary value-context loop expressions
accept `void`.

## Reassignment

Reassignment updates an already resolved symbol:

```pine
x := x + 1
```

Rules:

- Reassignment to an unknown name is a semantic error.
- Reassignment must respect the symbol's declared value kind.
- The assigned expression may strengthen the qualifier only when the language
  rules allow the target to become series-qualified.
- Reassignment inside a local scope must resolve according to Pine scoping
  rules, not ordinary block-local shadowing assumptions.

## `var`

`var` declarations initialize once at the first execution of their declaration
site:

```pine
var x = 0
```

Rules:

- The declaration site owns persistent storage.
- The initializer runs only when the declaration site is first reached.
- Later executions read the persistent value.
- Local `var` declarations in blocks and inlined user-defined functions use
  declaration-site storage, with independent storage per syntactic UDF callsite.
- Reassignment writes the persistent value for subsequent bars.

`var` storage is separate from ordinary per-bar local values and from committed
series history.

## Function Calls

Each built-in and user-defined function call must have a stable callsite id.

Callsite ids are needed because many functions have stateful series behavior.
For example, two separate calls to `ta.ema(close, 20)` must not accidentally
share rolling state unless the language semantics require sharing.

The lowering stage should assign callsite ids before runtime execution.

## User-Defined Functions

User-defined functions are supported by lowering each callsite inline.
Expression bodies lower directly as expressions. Multi-statement block bodies
lower as block expressions that execute local statements and return the value
of the final expression, local declaration, local reassignment, conditional,
or loop. Positional and named arguments are resolved to the declared parameter
list before semantic analysis of the function body.

Current rules:

- Resolve parameters and local symbols.
- Infer return kind and qualifier.
- Reject recursion.
- Allocate independent callsite state for every syntactic callsite.
- Functions called conditionally follow the same conditional callsite rules as
  built-ins.
- Resolve local declarations and reassignments inside function block bodies to
  callsite-local symbols.
- Preserve parameter shadowing when a function-local declaration or loop counter
  uses the same name as a parameter.
- Reject duplicate or unknown named UDF arguments and positional arguments after
  named arguments.
- Evaluate arguments once into callsite-local temporaries before evaluating the
  inlined function body.
- Reject output side effects inside functions.
- Reject global reassignment inside functions.
- Reject side-effecting calls as UDF arguments.
- Treat a missing final-conditional `else` as `na`, and allow `void` only when
  it is the valid result of a function-final side-effect structure; ordinary
  value-context loops remain strict.
